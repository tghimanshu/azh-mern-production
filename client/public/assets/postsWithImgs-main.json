One is essentially buying a company. In other words one owns a company. Hence the importance of owning a company which has good corporate governance practices.  Investment Management firms need to look at earnings and growth in earnings. But long term wealth management companies also look at management of the companies and corporate governance issues.  Recently Narayan Murthy of Infosys has spoken a great deal on corporate governance. He said lack of corporate governance is sure path to destruction of companies. One need not recount recent events at Infosys to realize that Mr. Narayan Murthy means what he says.  A well governed company provides assurance to investors that it will be stable. Earnings and growth in earnings, though directly impacting stock prices are secondary. Fundamental thing is if the corporate governance is above board and reflects of healthy practices.  Long terms investors who are risk averse would look at fair corporate governance practices. Hence companies should look at corporate governance issues substantially to get good valuation.  As per Rivel research, good corporate governance practice gives 10% premium on stock market price. But bad corporate governance practices discounts share price by as much as 30%. Nearly 94% of investors rated corporate governance as important. Nearly 57% of investors believed that corporate governance was more important relative to few years ago, compared to just 1% who believed it was less important.  Corporate Governance consists of four important issues as per Rivel Research : <ol> <li>Commitment to transparency and disclosure.</li> <li>Objective Board of Directors.</li> <li>Clear code of ethical conduct.</li> <li>Management pay linked to performance.</li> </ol> Other  issues were <ol> <li>Separation of CEO and Chairman role</li> <li>Succession plan for CEO</li> <li>Good governance rating service score</li> <li>Meaningful CSR guidelines.</li> </ol> <strong>CREDENT ASSET </strong>- Invest your belief in us <em>Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate</em>", "slug": "corporate-governance-issues-and-hit-on-investment-sentiment", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Blog1.jpg"}, {"title": "Should more privatisation of banks required to increase efficiency or consolidation of small PSU Banks is required", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/should-more-privatisation-of-banks-required-to-increase-efficiency-or-consolidation-of-small-psu-banks-is-required/", "content": "The recent spate of frauds in Public Sector Banks has led to increase in the debate on if PSU banks should be privatized. Or something else needs to be done. Very clearly business as usual approach is not an acceptable alternative. There is a need for a drastic overhaul as some Investment Management companies are suggesting.  Firstly, consolidation of PSU banks is not a good idea. PSU banks are already huge and consolidation will make them even more unmanageable. One cannot hope to achieve efficiency by combining inefficient entities.  The case for privatization of public sector banks is a strong one. The privatization of any entity \u2013 airlines, hotels, leads to increase in efficiency and accountability. This is a universal experience across all nations. Hence it is only to be expected that privatizing public sector banks will increase efficiency.  Just compare performance of public sector banks to performance of private sector banks. On all fronts, whether it is profits or growth, private sector banks have performed better than public sector banks.  Privatising banks will ensure that market discipline forces these banks to improve their strategy and execution so that they turn profitable.  However, privatising public sector banks is not going to be easy. There is likely to fierce political opposition as well as opposition from bank employees. These need to be handled with care and assurance.  The social objectives of public sector banks should not be lost in the wind of privatisation. Also employees should be assured of job security during privatisation.  Presently this debate on privatisation of public sector banks is academic and intellectual. Unless political will for this is created it is likely to remain so. Both the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister seem to be opposed to privatisation.  There needs to pressure coming from people for need for privatisation. The performance of public sector banks as well as frauds coming to light is compelling a debate on privatisation of public sector banks.  It would be unwise to expect anything drastic happening within few years, if the present political opinion is anything to go by. However if this debate is instigated at a national level and people and industry bodies bring about change of political will, something could get triggered within a decade.  Our view is that there should be greater discussion on privatisation of public sector banks. Democracy will then bring the necessary change.  <strong>CREDENT ASSET </strong>- Invest your belief in us <em>Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate</em>", "slug": "should-more-privatisation-of-banks-required-to-increase-efficiency-or-consolidation-of-small-psu-banks-is-required", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1stMar.jpg"}, {"title": "Is The Worst Over for Indian IT Sector?", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/is-the-worst-over-for-indian-it-sector/", "content": "Nasscom sees a muted growth for Indian IT sector for the year 2018-19. It sees next year\u2019s growth to be around 7-9 percent up from current year\u2019s 6-8 percent. Nasscom has pared its job forecasts to 1 lakh jobs from 1.5 lakh jobs. As against projected 1.3 lakh-15 lakh jobs in 2017-18, the year ended  with only 1 lakh jobs.  The Industry will close 2017-18 with revenues of $ 167 billion with software and services revenues crossing $ 150 billion. Exports for 2018-19 are pegged at $ 135-137 billion, a growth of over 7-9 per cent over 2017-18s $ 126 billion, while domestic market could grow by 10-12 percent to $28-29 billion from $ 26 billion this year.  A 7-9 percent growth in any other sector would be considered healthy and encourage investments. Indeed 7-9% growth is considered to be the fastest growing economy. However in IT sector this is being considered as slow down and indeed people are talking about this being death of IT sector.  One must question, why is this? Why are investment management companies not cheering 7-9% growth rate? Why are some asset management firms in India morose over 7-9% growth rate? Why is a healthy growth rate such a bad new for wealth management companies  in India?  This is because in IT sector we are used to 40% growth rate. Indian IT sector, grew out of practically nothing in early 90s to becoming a very huge sector by 2010 or thereabouts. In the process IT companies grew manifold times and gave spectacular returns to investors.  Hence there has been an increase in expectations. A 40% growth rate is an unusual growth rate that is extremely rarely achieved. It happens rarely in any sector in any nation. What India witnessed in the last decade of 20th century and even in the first decade of 21st century was unusually robust growth of IT sector.  It is wrong to expect such a growth rate to continue forever. Questions such as \u2018Is worst over for IT sector\u2019 are wrong. They are based on unrealistic expectations. Economies and Industries must consider themselves healthy if they grow at 7-9%. So instead of bemoaning the end of very unusual growth rate of 40%, we must get realistic and get used to a very healthy growth rate of 7-9%.  A 7-9% growth rate is a healthy growth rate and can provide good return on investments. People should pare down their expectations and understand that the days of 40% growth rate in IT sector are over and the new normal is 7-9% growth rate, which is healthy.  <strong>CREDENT ASSET </strong>- Invest your belief in us <em>Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate</em>", "slug": "is-the-worst-over-for-indian-it-sector", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/8thtMar.jpg"}, {"title": "Impact of Trade War on Global Economy", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/impact-of-trade-war-on-global-economy/", "content": "It is all over the news. The Trump trade war is likely to impact global economy adversely. The global economy could contract by around $ 500 billion due to the trade war. Some wealth management companies are ringing alarm bells.  Politicians impose tariffs to protect domestic jobs in a bid to appease certain constituency. However they do not realize that such protectionist measures are likely to be met with retaliatory measures from other nations.  This leads to trade war and instead of protectionist measures benefiting the economy, it actually contracts the economy.  Trade takes place because nations with comparative advantage produce at higher level of productivity and reduced cost. This is the lesson from Economics 101, an introductory course in schools and colleges. Reducing productivity leads to a shrinking economy.  In the current round, Donald Trump has decided to impose tariffs on steel. This is leading to Europe and China imposing tariffs on American products. This could lead to another round of tariffs from America, in a tit for tat measures. But overall the impact would be bad for the global economy.  Economists are notorious for not agreeing on anything. We usually hear of the ambidextrous economist, who stars by explaining \u201cOn one hand, this could happen and on other hand this could\u201d.  But in this case economists are in unison. Almost every economist is of the view that the global economy would contract by as much as half a trillion dollars due to the proposed to tariffs. Yet the President of United States is bent on trade war.  The President may win a limited battle, but nobody wins in a trade war and it is lose-lose proposition. One hopes wisdom may dawn upon the president and he would act more wisely. However Mr. Trump is ignoring protestations by economic advisors and fellow politicians.  The global economy has delicately recovered after a long time of high fuel prices. This is the worst time to upset the balance and act as a bull in china shop. It is unfortunate that this is happening.  The world will be a poorer place due to this trade war. Open economies lead to all round prosperity and protectionist measures hurt everyone including those whom it was intended to protect. This must be carved in gold.  Politicians should not yield to appeasement politics and should put sound economics over opportunistic politics in their policy formulation.

So before choosing an investment avenue, one should not be influenced too much by immediate returns but take a long term view.  Now before deciding on gold or stock market as an investment avenue one must consider rate of return in these two investment classes. Now Gold has offered almost same rate of return as stock market. Investment management companies need to take a look at gold as investment option.  Over the last 15 years, Gold has offered annualised return of 13.66%, marginally lower than Sensex return over the same period of 13.97%. While gold prices are also volatile they are less volatile than stock market. Gold annualised standard deviation was 16.62 compared to 24.35 for Sensex.  People in western nations invest in gold as protection against inflation. But in India, it also protects against currency depreciation.  The stock markets are currently very volatile. The stock markets have fallen by over 10% in last 2 months or so in India. The Dow Jones Index has also fallen. People are talking of a crash in US market. This could bring markets down globally.  Things are not looking good for stock market at this point in time. One cannot say about future. Should you consider gold?  What are your options? Real Estate is priced low. But there is less liquidity in real estate. Venture Capital is risky. Stock Markets are very volatile.  And gold offers as good return as Sensex. So gold cannot be ruled out. But stock market has its own attractions. While Sensex has offered 13.66% return, many Mutual Funds perform better.  Secondly, only stock markets can offer you 20-50% returns. Nobody becomes as rich as Rakesh Jhunjhunwala by investing in gold.  So should you invest in gold? This is for each individual investor to decide on own. Gold will never offer you very great returns. But gold matches stock markets in rate of return.  Especially in 2018, when stock markets are volatile, it may be a good bed to consider investing gold.  At this point in time stock markets look very volatile and hence gold offers a close competition to stock market. But should markets correct or even crash in 2018, as some are predicting for US markets, then stock market is wrong place to be in.

The government seems to be so reluctant to denationalise or privatize bank that Wealth Management Companies in India have given up hope.  But Investment Management Companies should not despair. Remember the socialistic seventies. We never thought that India would ever reform and liberalize. And that India would get stuck in a bullock cart growth rate of 3.5% forever.  However in nineties this changed and the license permit raj was kicked out of India even as India liberalized and growth rate has since increased to around 7% per annum Things happen in India. Would Asset management companies in India have imagined that India would be the fastest growing economy in the world? Things change in India even if slowly than we would like.Wiser views do prevail over outdated mindsets.  The time for PSU Bank privatisation may not be now. But, PSU banks definitely will get privatised.  Consider the facts. The market capitalisation of public sector banks is lower than that of HDFC Bank. If you consider stock market performance of public sector banks in last 4 years, about 11 out of 14 PSU banks have seen their market cap eroding between 11 to 75%.  Consider the NPA \u2013 Nonperforming assets of public sector banks stood at over Rs. 7 lakh crores, whereas the Non performing assets of private sector banks was around Rs. 1 lakh crores. Admittedly PSU banks have twice the assets as private banks, but very clearly public sector banks have fared miserably in the bad loans department.  Public sector banks have twice the assets as Private sector banks in India. Usually in most countries the ratio is that public sector banks have half the assets as private sector banks.  The PNB fraud is just a case in point and may have triggered a debate. But the rot runs deeps and needs a surgery. With PSU banks market capitalisation reducing, they are good targets for takeover and over haul.  There will be many purchasers for PSU banks as they are getting to be affordable.  Eventually PSU banks will be taken over by private players. The question is not \u2018if\u2019, but \u2018when\u2019. Once PSU banks market cap erodes substantially, government won\u2019t find sense in carrying the burden and sooner or later public sector banks will be privatised.  <strong>CREDENT ASSET </strong>- Invest your belief in us <em>Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate</em>", "slug": "will-our-nationalized-banks-ever-get-denationalized", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/29thMar.jpg"}, {"title": "Why is Indian Market Underperforming?", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/why-is-indian-market-underperforming/", "content": "Expectations! Expectation!! Expectations!!!  Stock markets are gauged by expectations. There is little of sensible thinking in evaluating the market. People expect unreasonable and continuing returns from the stock market and get disappointed, when that does not happen.  How does one answer the question, such as why is Indian Market Underperforming?  By pointing that Indian market is not underperforming.  Just in 30 th December 2017, Economic Times had a headline, that Markets end 2017 with a bang, Sensex reaches record high. Sensex had closed that day above, 34000.  In fact the article in 30 th December 2017 rated Indian markets as one of the best performing global markets with year to date return of around 30 percent.  Today the Sensex is around 33000. And hence people are asking why is Indian market underperforming?  Never mind, that Sensex had risen to around 36000 in early part of 2018. Yet some downward movement of Sensex and people raise impossible question that why is Indian market underperforming?  Firstly let us get this right. Finally markets have to reflect fundamentals. When the economy is growing at 7 percent and inflation is hovering around 4-5%, a good return on stock market is only 15-18 percent.  If the equity market has returned 30% in 2017, clearly it has outpaced itself and the markets must correct themselves. Hence there is some correction.  Also there is global scare due to Trump Trade war. All markets are down to some extent.  Consider US markets. The Dow Jones Index was around 26,600 towards end of January 2018, and currently it is trading at 23,600. Nikkei Index is down from 24,120 towards end of January 2018 to just above 21,000 now. FTSE is down from 7800 in January to just above 7000 now. CAC is down from 5500 in January end to 5100 now. DAX is down from over 13500 to just above 12000. Shanghai is down from 3600 in January end to 3100 now. Hang seng index has fallen from above 33000 to below 30000 So the correction is happening globally. Stock markets do no function rationally.  Sometimes they grow much ahead of fundamentals, such as offering over 30% returns when economy is growing at just 7% and inflation is just 5%.  After such a wild rally markets must correct themselves to reflect fundamentals and hence there is some correction.

While the GST is a reasonable tax, many businesses may resort to profiteering in its cloak. GST is supposed to bring down prices, since you get input tax credit. These benefits must be ideally passed on to customers. However this is not done. Many businesses charge high rates stating GST as a reason.</p> <p>It is not only in India that GST is leading to profiteering. Many countries such as Australia and Singapore have seen a spurt in inflation after GST was implemented. In Australia for instance, the inflation spurted from 1.9% in the year before the GST was implemented to 5.9% in the year GST was implemented. Malaysia was successful in preventing profiteering by effectively implementing anti-profiteering laws. A formula was laid to check if the margins before implementation of GST were comparable to margins after the implementation of GST.</p> <p>The Government of India is thinking along similar lines. However its response has not been fast enough. The Government is constituting National Anti Profiteering Authority(NAA)  to ensure that unfair profit making by trading community is curbed and benefits of price reduction due to GST are passed on to consumers.</p> <p>But just constituting NAA without providing it sufficient legal muscle would be exercise in futility. Is there a need for adequately enhancing anti profiteering laws within GST Act to ensure that consumers are not charged unfairly or that GST does not lead to inflation?  The GST act has some anti profiteering provisions. Clause number 171 in GST act is intended to ensure that price reductions due to GST are passed on to customers. To be fair, India has not seen any spurt in inflation after GST has been implemented. Inflation continues to be subdued.  Enacting laws to check anti profiteering would take years considering the legislative disruptions in parliament due to unruly opposition. Enacting GST itself took years. So separate anti profiteering laws is not such a good idea.</p> <p>What needs to be done is to implement existing anti profiteering laws within the GST Act to ensure that organisations do not make unfair profits. If the NAA \u2013 National Anti Profiteering Authority does its task well much of profiteering will be kept in check. India is a nation with great laws and poor implementation. So anti profiteering laws would be a waste if they are not executed well.

Before the budget of February 2018, long term capital gains did not attract any taxation. However after the February 2018 budget, Long term capital gains is attracting taxation. Many people see this as a huge negative and even predict mass exodus away from stock market. But others see it as a minor irritant \u2013 and nothing more. Which is the right approach?</p> <p>Will LTCG(Long Term Capital Gain Tax) lead to exit from the stock markets? Will it lead to people reducing their investment duration? These are two separate questions that need to be answered. We also need to answer if the investors should change their investment strategy due to LTCG.</p> <p>Equities are in a class of their own when it comes to investing. No other investment class \u2013 fixed deposits, gold, bonds, even comes close to it. Equities offer at least a return of 14-15%, whereas Fixed Deposits give you 7% return, Gold gives you near about 10%. If you choose rights stocks you can get returns of 20-30% or even 40-50% a year. Thus equities can double your money in 2-5 years, whereas it would take nearly 10 years in fixed deposits.</p> <p>Just because there is minor long term capital gains tax on Equities is no reason to switch from equities to other investment asset. Admittedly, paying LTCG is minor irritant. But the return from equities is far in excess of the small tax that you have to pay. Investors will choose to live with minor tax than live without investing in equities.</p> <p>Will investors reduce their investment duration from long term to short term? Or should you reduce investment duration? Again equities only give substantial returns in long term. Only when the fundamentals of companies change such as incomes, revenues, profits, the price of equity changes considerably. This takes time. You cannot expect profits to change within month or two. These could few quarters or few years. Hence it pays to be invested for long duration of time. People who make serious money on stock markets stay invested for long.</p> <p>Just because there is minor long term capital gains tax is no reason to switch from long term investing to short term investing. Serious money is made only in long term investing and not short term investing. Hence there is no reason to reduce or change investment duration from long term investing to short term investing because of Long Term Capital Gains Tax.</p> <p>To summarise LTCG is just a minor irritant and it won\u2019t have or shouldn\u2019t have any impact on either switching from equities to other investment classes or in switching from long term investment to short term investment.

ATMs are running dry. It is reminder of demonetisation days. While then, people may have been willing to forgive the government for the pain because of promise of curbing black money, people are now asking why this cash crunch.  Actually government has been underestimating the need for cash in the economy. Government is assuming that India is on path to become a cash less society or at least a less cash society, hence there is not as much need for currency.  Why is there cash crunch in economy of India , now in April 2018. This question begs an answer and an answer that is mere guess will not help. For instance an answer such as Karnataka elections, will the raise a question, why was there no cash crunch during Gujarat elections. To be sure, Telugu Desam, according to reports had been raising the issue of cash crunch for past couple of months. So the cash crunch was not entirely a bolt out of blue.  If one considers the growth of cash over last few years that provides a more concrete and reliable answer. According to CMIE, between 2012-2014, while the nominal GDP grew by around 28.6%, the cash with public increased by 21.7%. Even then there was no currency crunch as economy had adequate cash. Between 2014-2016, currency growth increased to 28.3%, whereas the economy grew by 22.5%. This created adequate currency.  However after 2016, currency growth has slowed down considerably. The nominal GDP has grown by 21.7% between 2016-2018, However currency growth has stagnated with currency growth barely at 10.2% between 2016-18.  This is the actual reason for cash crunch.The currency growth in last two years has been less than half of the growth of nominal GDP and hence any small spurt in demand leads to cash crunch.  This is not rocket science. Nor is this data so confidential that it is not part of information of decision makers. The government was well aware that adequate cash is not being created to take care of growth of GDP. Yet government allowed this to fester.  The treatment for this malady is to grow cash in pace with the growth in nominal GDP. We are not a cashless society or less cash society. And till that happens, government must ensure that adequate cash is created in line with growth of GDP.

Multi-asset funds, which invest in different assets and increase/decrease allocation according to the prospects of each, can be a solution to this problem.  \"In uncertain times, there is heightened apprehension in the minds of investors due to which they avoid financial investments. The advantage of such funds is that the onus is on the fund manager to toggle <strong>between different assets and optimise returns. </strong>Also, there is no temptation to time the market as these funds retain exposure to each asset. The exposure level, of course, will be guided by the fund manager's market view.\"The <strong>traditional types of multi asset funds</strong> are balanced funds and monthly income funds, which invest only in two assets-equity and debt. The newer ones offer exposure to more assets. So, in India, to cash in on the rally in gold, a few fund houses have launched funds that invest in equity, debt as well as gold, while in western markets multi-asset funds invest in all assets ranging from equity, debt, real estate, commodities, private equity and hedge funds.  Some of the biggest advantages of investing in multi-asset funds are mentioned below: <strong>Diversification:</strong> People invest in these funds to get exposure to a number of assets. Diversification dilutes risk as every asset class has its own risk-return profile and performs differently over each market cycle. It makes sense to invest in asset classes which have a very low correlation or, better still, a negative correlation with each other. A good performance of one asset class, in such a case, will support the overall portfolio returns when other assets are not doing well. By investing in more than one asset, one can reduce the risk of losing money. Also, overall returns will have a smoother ride. If one asset does poorly, investor may be in a position to cover the loss with better returns from other asset(s).  <strong>Automatic rebalancing:</strong> Most investors do not have the time and skills to do such rebalancing. Therefore, they must leave the job to professionals.  Fund managers of multi-asset funds do periodic re-balancing by booking gains from one asset which is performing relatively better and investing the money in the asset which is under-performing.  <b>Ready-made</b><strong> portfolio:</strong> These funds offer the investor a well-rounded portfolio provided investor is comfortable with the allocation to different assets made by the fund manager.Many investors don't like to hold too many funds. Multi-asset funds are ideal for such investors as they provide exposure to different assets in a single investment.  <strong>CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate", "slug": "multi-asset-funds-the-wise-way-to-invest-today", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Blog_july1.jpg"}, {"title": "The Market, in the coming days", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/the-market-in-the-coming-days/", "content": "<strong>Market may not go up in a hurry!</strong> August 31st, post market hours, the GDP data for Q1FY19 was released and everyone thought that with an 8.2 per cent GDP growth rate (annualised) the economy was in top gear.

Pharma, which has not been a favourite of investors in last many years, has outperformed all sectors as well as popular indices with a gain of 15%.  <strong>Shhh\u2026..Whispers of the market</strong> At the same time some of the richly valued stocks have also come under pressure like Bajaj Finance and Nestle which are down by 7%. So, what is the market suggesting? The message is clear: don\u2019t chase stocks whose valuations are stretched. The market is not in a mood pay such stretched valuations. Also, it gives the feeling that sector rotation is happening.  Overall the market is trading at rich valuations. The one year forward PE of the Nifty is trading at 20 times, which is the highest amongst all leading markets of the world. The US is trading at 16.6 times one year forward PE while the eurozone at 13.4 times and China at 10.9 times.  <strong>Moving forward</strong> Historically, it has been observed that whenever the rate of interest moves up, the PE contracts. In its last two monetary policies the RBI has hiked the interest rate by 50 basis points. And it is probably not done with its rate hikes; we should expect at least two more (one is certain) by March 2019. Crude oil prices have softened a little bit as India\u2019s crude oil basket price, which was $73.47 per barrel in July, came down to $72.53 per barrel. But the impact of the same was not felt by India as the rupee depreciated against the dollar, increasing landing costs of crude. Higher crude oil prices push inflation higher. During election time the government has a tendency not to fully pass on the higher crude oil prices to the end consumer. We have experienced this during the Karnataka and Gujarat state assembly elections. In the next couple of months Rajasthan, MP and Chhattisgarh are going in for assembly polls. There is high likelihood that the Modi government may not pass on the higher crude oil prices to end consumers. That means either oil marketing companies may run into problem or the government will be forced to reduce taxes, impacting revenue and resulting in higher deficits. Yesterday\u2019s Bharat Bandh clearly shows that the Opposition is going to make higher petrol and diesel prices an election issue. The Modi government will have a tough time navigating the higher crude oil prices and in turn higher inflation.  <strong> </strong> <strong>So, what now?</strong> The signals that are emerging suggest that one should be stock specific in this market. Look closely at the valuations you are paying. If the valuations are stretched it is very likely that company is going to either underperform or at best be a market performer. We have a feeling that there are many headwinds for the market that may not allow the overall market to move up. FPIs are anyway not very positive on emerging markets and India is feeling this pressure. Till now domestic liquidity has been keeping the Sensex at a high level. But to move to a new high more liquidity is needed \u2013 both domestic as well as FPI. We don\u2019t see that happening in the near term.  So, play your cards well. Look for a margin of safety as we have a heavy political calendar over the next nine months.  <strong><em>A stock-specific approach is the need of the hour.</em></strong> <strong>Written By</strong> <strong>Sunil Damania Market Expert </strong> <strong>CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate", "slug": "the-market-in-the-coming-days", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Blog_sep1.jpg"}, {"title": "ROCE, the Secret Winning Edge to any Portfolio", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/roce-the-secret-winning-edge-to-any-portfolio/", "content": "<strong>The Magic of ROCE</strong> The 2007 letter of Berkshire Hathaway is a classic.

In that letter, Warren Buffett narrates the success of See\u2019s Candy.  \u201cWe bought See\u2019s for $25 million when its <strong>sales were $30 million and pre-tax earnings were less than $5 million. The capital then required to conduct the business was $8 million</strong> (Modest seasonal debt was also needed for a few months each year). Consequently, the company was earning 60% pre-tax on invested capital. Two factors helped to minimize the funds required for operations. First, the product was sold for cash, and that eliminated accounts receivable. Second, the production and distribution cycle was short, which minimized inventories.  Last year See\u2019s <strong>sales were $383 million, and pre-tax profits were $82 million. The capital now required to run the business is $40 million</strong>. This means we have had to reinvest only $32 million since 1972 to handle the modest physical growth \u2013 and somewhat immodest financial growth \u2013 of the business. In the meantime pre-tax earnings have totaled $1.35 billion. All of that, except for the $32 million, has been sent to Berkshire (or, in the early years, to Blue Chip). After paying corporate taxes on the profits, we have used the rest to buy other attractive businesses. Just as Adam and Eve kick-started an activity that led to six billion humans, See\u2019s has given birth to multiple new streams of cash for us. (The biblical command to 'be fruitful and multiply' is one we take seriously at Berkshire.) There aren\u2019t many See\u2019s in Corporate America. <strong>Typically, companies that increase their earnings from $5 million to $82 million require, say, $400 million or so of capital investment to finance their growth. That\u2019s because growing businesses have both working capital needs that increase in proportion to sales growth and significant requirements for fixed asset investments.</strong> A company that needs large increases in capital to engender its growth may well prove to be a satisfactory investment. There is, to follow through on our example, nothing shabby about earning $82 million pre-tax on $400 million of net tangible assets. But that equation for the owner is vastly different from the See\u2019s situation. <strong>It\u2019s far better to have an ever-increasing stream of earnings with virtually no major capital requirements.</strong>Ask Microsoft or Google.\u201d &nbsp; <strong>ROCE = EBIT/Capital Employed</strong> How do we calculate ROCE? Well, there are a few variants. But the easiest one is shown in <a href=\"http://r.marketsmojo.info/mk/cl/QmLnpGb9gxya58ixFVvKThpzfOb5OXOhulHUv1lP-ZOquvew_mFa2zFWL8c7uaMbnJCYV-2V88tDA25hvcca2WXVpcshpeeSMM5U_IVUoWwbcA\">this</a> paper by Mirae Asset Management. Marketsmojo uses the same method.  EBIT is easy to calculate, but what about the Capital Employed? The paper says: \u201cCapital Employed is the capital investment necessary for a business to function. It is commonly represented as Total Assets Less Current liabilities (or Fixed Assets plus Working Capital).\u201d ROCE is a far more useful measure compared to Return on Equity (ROE) as: \u201c ROCE is especially useful when comparing the performance of companies in capital-intensive sectors such as utilities and telecom. This is because unlike Return on Equity (ROE), which only analyzes profitability related to a company\u2019s equity, ROCE considers debt and other liabilities as well. This provides a better indication of financial performance for companies with significant debt.\u201d It follows from the equation that in order to generate high ROCE, a company must either have very high profit margins or need low levels of Capital Employed or a combination of the two.  <em>We have had many such companies in India as well. Many consumer related business enjoy high ROCE due to their Asset Light nature. Hindustan Unilever with ROCE at close to 800%, Nestle at 400%, Page Industries at 84% are great examples.</em> &nbsp; <strong>High ROCE Means High Valuation</strong> In 1997, when running research for HSBC, I had written a piece on the importance of ROCE. I had found that, everything else remaining the same, high ROCE companies enjoy far higher valuation than companies with low ROCE. <em>At least for the companies where market believes that the high ROCE is sustainable.</em> A 2011 <a href=\"http://r.marketsmojo.info/mk/cl/7aDlu0lj8T_-e6t4VaL5ns-qlv6hH0DZT5-fZI5aJAGA8IntnHTkf3olZ7H-bEkYncSB8KFoPXwH4AOzesZdEMy4UgLIkriooyswxUrt-Kcxgw\">report</a>, \u201cImpact of ROCE on valuation\u201d, by PWC concluded: \u201cCompanies that deliver better Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) experience higher valuation\u201d The relationship remains the same today.

At Marketsmojo, the five-year average ROCE is one of the most important metric used in our Quality Parameter.  <strong>An interesting example: The Abrasives Industry</strong> Let us look at the Abrasives Industry (which was picked randomly) which has a fairly uniform product, the relationship between the five-year average ROCE and Price/Book Value is fairly consistent with the findings above.  <em>Next time you look at a stock, don\u2019t forget to look at its long term ROCE \u2013 it\u2019ll give you an insight about the inherent strength of the company\u2019s business, and its ability to squeeze value from every rupee of capital.

In December 2017, it had an AUM of $6.3 trillion. It is truly a global firm with 70 offices in 30 countries and clients in 100 countries.  Fortunately, Blackrock shares their insights regularly on their website. For example, their latest weekly commentary can be seen <a href=\"http://r.marketsmojo.info/mk/cl/FkLt7Hy8SJzuaVl-iVuFqVY6mW29Tg6yAgBdpmBVt6YM9dsDcnXx6GwvOLpbtOCPLybwXePlMF5jCLVOmw96TMz1j4fHHTlwktXrnzwoiDdptw\">here.</a> Here are the excerpts: <strong>On Trade War:</strong> Rising trade conflicts have been front and center in the markets and the media. So far they have had limited impact on global earnings \u2013 or the earnings outlook. There are exceptions: Consumer discretionary firms were among the first to feel the pinch from tariffs. Case in point: Global auto and household appliance makers guided earnings lower after the U.S. slapped tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Corporate executives in most other sectors are expressing confidence that much of the increased cost can be passed on.  <strong>On Markets:</strong> They expect earnings growth, dividends and share buybacks \u2013 not multiple expansion (rising price-to-earnings ratios) \u2013 to drive equity returns over the coming quarters. They see solid fundamentals underpinning global growth and supporting corporate earnings, though geopolitical risks such as trade conflicts are amplifying economic uncertainty. They believe portfolio resilience is critical against this backdrop. They prefer companies with strong balance sheets and solid earnings momentum. They find these primarily in the U.S.  They also like EM equities supported by economic reforms, improving corporate fundamentals and reasonable valuations, but see escalating trade conflicts and a stronger U.S. dollar as potential risks. A currency crisis in Turkey highlights the risks in EM economies dependent on external funding, and argues for a selective approach.  <strong>Aberdeen Standard Life Insights</strong> Standard Life Aberdeen plc is one of the world\u2019s largest investment companies, created in 2017 from the merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management. They are the largest active manager in the UK and one of the largest in Europe. They have a significant global presence Like Blackrock they share their insights regularly on their website.

This has been due mainly to worldwide issues but also country-specific political uncertainty.  They highlight three external factors that are impacting the Emerging Markets: <strong>Rising US interest rates and a stronger dollar\u2013</strong> Many EMs have large piles of debt denominated in US dollars \u2013 when the dollar strengthens, so too does the value of that debt. Another reason why the dollar matters is that a strong dollar can dampen world trade. Additionally, depreciation of an EM currency puts pressure on its central bank to raise interest rates, which can then slow domestic growth.  <strong>Slowing industrial growth in China\u2013</strong>  The weakness in China\u2019s industrial activity has been offset by strength in services, so that overall growth looks healthy. However, the slowdown in the more externally facing industrial sector has spilled over into some weakness in world trade, which affects other EMs.  <strong>Trade protectionism\u2013</strong> Many small, open EMs are disproportionately impacted by recent trade actions. They are affected both directly through the loss of value-add provided to Chinese exporters, and indirectly through the broader move away from multi-country trade systems. Indeed, even before tariffs were implemented, trade flows appear to have been disrupted as sentiment deteriorated.  However, they seem to be pretty bullish over the longer term when they say : <strong>Importantly, we note that, although EM fundamentals have weakened slightly over the past year, they remain healthier than during previous EM crisis episodes.</strong> Thinking Globally I have presented only some of the resources that are freely available. Of course, there are more such resources and there are some of the global business websites like Bloomberg, CNBC, WSJ, Financial Times and Reuters where one can get regular updates on what is happening globally.  Depending on whether you trade or are a long-term investor you may choose how much time you wish to invest in keeping updated with global trends.

Many experts believed then that Indian stock indices would give a positive salute to this GDP growth number and the rally would extend. But that was not the case. On 3rd September (first day after GDP data was released) the Sensex was down by 333 points and the slide continued over the subsequent days barring a few when the Sensex showed some resistance. Today the Sensex is trading at 37413 as against a 38645 closing level on 31 August 31st \u2013 down by 1200 points in the last seven days of trading. But a 1200 point fall does not explain how much pain investors are feeling as some of the old favourite stocks/sectors are not finding buyers even at lower levels.  <strong>Randomness has taken over</strong> Take the case of the FMCG sector, which was the darling of investors not so long ago: HUL has gone down by 9% in the last one month, Venky\u2019s by 16% and Vadilal Industries by 31%. In the last week none of the stocks of the NSE FMCG were in the green. On the other hand pharma stocks are back in demand. None of the NSE Pharma stocks have been in the red in the last one month. Look at Aurobindo Pharma which has gone up by 31% in the last one month. Sun Pharma gave returns of 15% and Lupin 17%. Pharma, which has not been a favourite of investors in last many years, has outperformed all sectors as well as popular indices with a gain of 15%.  <strong>Shhh\u2026..Whispers of the market</strong> At the same time some of the richly valued stocks have also come under pressure like Bajaj Finance and Nestle which are down by 7%. So, what is the market suggesting? The message is clear: don\u2019t chase stocks whose valuations are stretched. The market is not in a mood pay such stretched valuations. Also, it gives the feeling that sector rotation is happening.  Overall the market is trading at rich valuations. The one year forward PE of the Nifty is trading at 20 times, which is the highest amongst all leading markets of the world. The US is trading at 16.6 times one year forward PE while the eurozone at 13.4 times and China at 10.9 times.  <strong>Moving forward</strong> Historically, it has been observed that whenever the rate of interest moves up, the PE contracts. In its last two monetary policies the RBI has hiked the interest rate by 50 basis points. And it is probably not done with its rate hikes; we should expect at least two more (one is certain) by March 2019. Crude oil prices have softened a little bit as India\u2019s crude oil basket price, which was $73.47 per barrel in July, came down to $72.53 per barrel. But the impact of the same was not felt by India as the rupee depreciated against the dollar, increasing landing costs of crude. Higher crude oil prices push inflation higher. During election time the government has a tendency not to fully pass on the higher crude oil prices to the end consumer. We have experienced this during the Karnataka and Gujarat state assembly elections. In the next couple of months Rajasthan, MP and Chhattisgarh are going in for assembly polls. There is high likelihood that the Modi government may not pass on the higher crude oil prices to end consumers. That means either oil marketing companies may run into problem or the government will be forced to reduce taxes, impacting revenue and resulting in higher deficits. Yesterday\u2019s Bharat Bandh clearly shows that the Opposition is going to make higher petrol and diesel prices an election issue.

FPIs are anyway not very positive on emerging markets and India is feeling this pressure. Till now domestic liquidity has been keeping the Sensex at a high level. But to move to a new high more liquidity is needed \u2013 both domestic as well as FPI. We don\u2019t see that happening in the near term.  So, play your cards well.

We have another problem.  <strong>As human-beings we have a deep-seated bias\u2026</strong> we like to hold on to our losing stocks in the hope that they come back and readily sell those that are \u201cin-profit\u201d since we think that we can lock in those gains. As a result, <u>we sometimes sell our best and highest potential bets, and keep holding onto companies that are performing poorly.</u> <strong>And here\u2019s the double whammy</strong> That comes by holding onto underperforming companies. - when a stock you owned at 100 rupees falls by 30% (to Rs. 70) - for you to recover it has to rise by almost 50%- and you now need to realistically assess whether it is likely to rise by 50%. A low stock price can never help an underperforming company and equally a performing company can never be held down when the markets resume their activity.  <strong>In the long term - you should be only bothered about the company - the stock price will follow.</strong> To forget about the stock price and focus on the company and its performance and shift to the winners. However tough it may sound, it actually could be the best time to review your portfolio - The falling markets have sent you many signals about the quality of the stocks you hold, these should not be ignored.  <strong>Let Credent Asset Management &amp;Marketsmojo help you Optimise Your Portfolio.</strong> In a market where everything is going up, we forget the value of a well-constructed portfolio and end up buying stocks without thinking of them as being part of a portfolio.

We lost 1250 points on the Sensex this week.</strong> The way market behaved today scared investors. Many investors are asking \u2013 Is this the beginning of bear market? How does one explain so much volatility in the Nifty and Sensex? On Friday, at one point of time, Sensex lost more than 1100 points, but later recovered with a loss of 280 points over the previous day\u2019s close. This market poses real danger to the NBFCs, who were the darling of the investors till the previous trading day. In last few years, these NBFCs created huge wealth for the investors, but today found no buyers even at lower levels. Dewan Housing Finance (DHFL) stock was down by as much as 55 per cent intra-day (as it\u2019s in F&amp;O, hence no upper or lower circuit) and recovered some ground after the management clarified that there is nothing wrong with the company and also, they have no exposure to IL&amp;FS. But the stock still closed at 42 per cent down from the previous day\u2019s close, suggesting that the market is no mood to buy the story. India Bulls Finance also came under pressure and closed the day with 8 per cent loss. Almost all NBFCs came under pressure on Friday, including names like Bajaj Finance and M&amp;M Finance. The market could not figure out why there has been sudden pressure on NBFC stocks. It would take some time before one can come out with credible explanation for this fall. Yes Bank, which is part of the Nifty and Sensex, lost 29 per cent on Friday, but it was expected that it will fall as RBI did not extend the tenure of Rana Kapoor as CMD of Yes Bank for three years, but the quantum of fall surprised the market participants. Rana would step down by January 2019 and the management will have to find a new CMD by then. It is not very clear at this point of time whether Rana would continue as a director on the bank. The carnage was equally severe on mid-caps and small-caps as Nifty Smallcap 100 was down by 3.53 per cent and Nifty Midcap 100 was down by 2.43 per cent.  <strong>Volatility has gone up</strong> When the markets closed last week, there was some kind of optimism, as, during the weekend, the government was expected to announce some measures that could help lift market sentiments. The government did announce some measures to stem the fall in the value of the rupee, but that did not help lift the Sensex. On Monday, Sensex lost more than 500 points, and then on every trading day this week, the market ended in the red. We lost 1250 points on the Sensex this week. In fact, the September month is turning out to be the worst month for the investors, as on two occasions out of 13 trading days, Sensex lost more than 500 points and on one occasion it lost 468 points. In the month of September, Sensex lost 1800 points and we are still nine days away from the end of this month. One thing is certain that the volatility in the stock market has increased. When volatility increases, the market moves sharply on either side. This time around, it is on the downside. The general sentiments have taken a huge beating and this is not something good for the market. The situation is more worrisome for the mid-caps and small-caps as these have seen some major falls.  The advance-decline ratio is worsening. There are more declines than advances. In the month of September, for Nifty 100 (consisting of large-caps), for every one advance, there were four declines. The situation is worse for the mid-caps and small-caps where for every one advance, there are eight declines.  <strong>So, is this the beginning of 2008?</strong> Now that brings in the question: Are we in the bear market? The answer is <strong>NO</strong>. While we may see some more corrections in the weeks and months to come, I don\u2019t expect situation like 2008. There are a couple of factors that make me believe this. First, India Inc earnings cycle is on the revival path (unlike in 2008, when it had peaked). It means that the earnings growth will keep the investors interested in the market. Second, we have a strong government at the Centre which is assuring that the fiscal discipline would be maintained. With the fear of the united opposition taking on the Modi regime fading (as Mayavati tied up with Jogi in Chhatisgarh and fighting on her own in MP), it increases the probability of Modi government retaining power in the next general elections. While I do expect domestic inflows to reduce, I don\u2019t expect outflows. While there was froth in the NBFCs and private sector banks, many of the sectors and companies are not in the expensive territory. That means there could be sector rotation in the market, but money may not go out of the market. But do expect more pains before we can have a smile back on the investor\u2019s face.  <strong>So how should one play this market?</strong> This kind of fall clearly suggests that the sentiments are not in favour of the bulls. There are headwinds for the market, which are becoming stronger and that makes the bull case scenario rather difficult to justify. In my September 11 column, we had warned investors not to chase stocks whose valuations are stretched (read <a href=\"https://www.marketsmojo.com/blog/mojo-view/will-this-market-fall-further-1140.html\">here</a>). We had then advised to adopt a stock-specific approach.  There is normally a tendency to chase stocks that have fallen significantly. I would rather suggest otherwise. Such stocks are not value buys. If one can recollect, in the past companies like Financial Technologies, Manpasand Beverages and Vakrangee did clarify when their scrips came under pressure that there was nothing wrong with the company, but these companies continued to fall post the clarifications too. DHFL did not bounce back significantly too post clarification. There is no point catching a falling knife. The need of the hour is to take shelter in the quality stocks that are available at reasonable valuations <a href=\"https://www.marketsmojo.com/mojostocks\">(click here to see a sample of such companies)</a>. Also, don\u2019t buy at one go but stagger your investments, as these companies would be available at good valuation for quite some time as I don\u2019t expect the market to run up in hurry. As mentioned in the September 11 article, Indian stock market valuation has become expensive (19 times one year forward and one of the costliest in the world) and with the rate of interest going up, PE should come down.  <strong>No momentum play</strong> Time is to avoid momentum play. Also, instead of taking 3-6 months view on the market, take at least one year view. But don\u2019t panic when the market behaves like it did today. Stay calm and take rational decisions. In situations like these, one should have control over fear. Time will come when your patience in the market will pay, provided you are invested in the right kind of companies. Right now, keep your expectations low from the market.  Overall, we feel, markets is cautious and good quality at reasonable valuation will be rewarded. Expectation needs to be reasonable and so long as you have greed &amp; fear control, you will be just OK!  <h2><em>The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official VIEW or position of Credent Asset Management.</em></h2> <strong>Sunil Damania</strong> Market Expert A chartered accountant, has 25 years of rich experience tracking Indian as well global stock markets.

The month of September has turned out to be worst month of 2018 as Sensex lost more than 2,400 points. Investors have become cautious. They are in no mood to pay extra premium to companies as concerns on growth has accelerated. Companies that were commanding crazy valuations are coming under pressure. This shows that the market players have changed their strategy from Risk-on to Risk-off. In the Risk-On strategy, investors are willing to take extra risk for capital gains, while in the Risk-off strategy, they are more cautious as they want to protect their capital. In other words, investors are now talking of return of capital rather than return on capital.  <table style=\"height: 615px;\"width=\"689\"> <tbody> <tr> <td width=\"753\"><strong>Month</strong></td> <td width=\"753\"><strong>Sensex Points </strong><strong style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit;\">Gain</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td width=\"753\"><strong>January</strong></td> <td width=\"753\">1908</td> </tr> <tr> <td width=\"753\"><strong>February</strong></td> <td width=\"753\">-1708</td> </tr> <tr> <td width=\"753\"><strong>March</strong></td> <td width=\"753\">-1215</td> </tr> <tr> <td width=\"753\"><strong>April</strong></td> <td width=\"753\">2191</td> </tr> <tr> <td width=\"753\"><strong>May</strong></td> <td width=\"753\">162</td> </tr> <tr> <td width=\"753\"><strong>June</strong></td> <td width=\"753\">101</td> </tr> <tr> <td width=\"753\"><strong>July</strong></td> <td width=\"753\">2138</td> </tr> <tr> <td width=\"753\"><strong>August</strong></td> <td width=\"753\">1038</td> </tr> <tr> <td width=\"753\"><strong>September</strong></td> <td width=\"753\">-2418</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <strong>Mid-cap and small-cap indices touch 52-week lows</strong> Many renowned investors are now searching for margin of safety, especially in the mid-caps and small caps as both the indices touched 52-week lows. A couple of months back, many mid-cap and small-cap companies were commanding higher PEs than large-cap companies on the assumption that they would report better growth in profits. But now investors are not willing to pay such premium as the recent fall in stock prices of few companies have shaken their confidence. Last Friday, DHFL crashed by more than 50 per cent and this Friday it was the turn of Infibeam Avenues, which collapsed by more than 70 per cent in a day. Like DHFL, Infibeam is also a part of F&amp;O stocks and hence did not carry circuit filter as is the case with normal stocks which have circuits in the range of 5-20 per cent. This kind of massive fall has perturbed investors. The next question that is now bothering the investors is: Who would be the next in line?  <strong>DHFL and Yes Bank Slide continues</strong> In our last Friday column, I had advised investors not to buy DHFL stock, despite the stock falling by 50 per cent as I was expecting more fall in its share price. That\u2019s what has happened, as DHFL this week is further down by 20 per cent. This clearly shows that investors are in no mood to accept the company\u2019s explanation that everything is hunky-dory. Similar trend was observed with Yes Bank too, which crashed by 23 per cent last Friday as RBI did not allow extension of Rana Kapoor as CMD of the bank beyond January 2019. That slide continued this week too, even though Yes Bank offered detailed explanation as sought by the NSE on Wednesday. This week Yes Bank is further down by 25 per cent despite Macquarie as well as J P Morgan coming out with Buy report, with the former giving price target of Rs 425 and the latter giving a target of Rs 400 (Friday, 28<sup>th</sup> September 28 closing price of Rs 183.45).  Even Deutsche Bank gave a target of Rs 300. I had warned investors that they should not try to do bottom-fishing in scrips like DHFL or Yes Bank as these are falling knives and hence should be avoided (read <a href=\"https://www.marketsmojo.com/blog/mojo-view/is-this-the-beginning-of-bear-market-1161.html\">here</a>). I continue to believe that these stocks will underperform in the months to come, despite these having fallen substantially.  Same way, Infibeam that crashed will find it hard to find buyers at the lower levels and hence one should also avoid doing bottom-fishing in this stock too. Basically, play safe and avoid urge to buy into fallen stocks as event may not have fully played out.  <strong>Negative News flow</strong> The news flow is also not helping the market as there is more negative news than positive news on the stock market. On Wednesday, the US Fed announced one more rate hike of 25 basis points and indicated one more hike before the end of 2018. That means more money would move from emerging markets to the US. That would put pressure on the rupee, which continues to slide. The RBI in its 5<sup>th</sup> October policy is likely to hike the rate by another 25 basis points, which would be the third hike in succession as it wants to defend the rupee. That would make the market more nervous as higher interest cost would not only increase the borrowing cost of companies, but the demand for goods and services would also be casualty. The higher interest rate would lure retail investors more towards fixed income products than equities, thereby impacting the flows into the markets. While FPIs sold heavily in the month of September, mutual funds did not buy as aggressively, resulting in net outflows (between FPIs and MF) and creating pressure on the market. Even the monsoon is below average to its long-term average, which suggests that the rural economy may slow down, thereby impacting the profitability of India Inc. On the other hand, WTO came out with a report suggesting that global trade would shrink during the current year as well as next year. This would impact manufacturing companies. So, the news flow is also not helping the markets.  With valuations continuing to be expensive, it makes sense to adopt a stock-specific approach with a close watch on the valuations you are paying. Since I don\u2019t expect the market to move up in a hurry (some odd day market may show some resistance but that would be temporary), you need to stagger your investments. Market will give you enough opportunities to buy your favourite stocks at reasonable valuations. In case you are confused about the strategy and do not have the stomach to face volatility, then it is better to stay away from the market for a couple of months. While I continue to believe that equity will give you better returns in the next 15-18 months, one cannot be that certain about the next 3-6 months. Bad sentiments may continue for a couple of months. Remain cool and calm. This is not the time to panic\u2014it is the time to weed out companies whose valuations are not backed by the fundamentals. Time to adjust portfolio with changing sentiments.  <em>The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official VIEW or position of www.marketsmojo.com</em> <strong>Sunil Damania</strong> Market Expert A chartered accountant, has 25 years of rich experience tracking Indian as well global stock markets.

At the same time there are worries that India Inc earnings growth would be casualty as rising crude oil, falling rupee and higher interest rate would put dent on earnings growth The stock market is in a punishing mood. Today, the Sensex was down by 800 points. This is on the back of yesterday\u2019s fall of 550 points. In two trading sessions, Sensex has lost more than 1300 points! Those who were thinking that there would be relief rally in the first week of October (as Sensex crashed by 2418 points in September) were taken by surprise by the fall in the last two days. What is worrying is that companies like Reliance and TCS, which were very strong, have come under pressure. Reliance today crashed by 7 per cent, while TCS declined by 4 per cent. So, when stalwarts start weakening, it does create huge negative sentiments for the overall market.  <strong>India Inc earnings growth would be a casualty</strong> There are couple of reasons for this mega fall. First and obvious is that the rising crude oil prices and the falling rupee against the dollar make it a deadly combination which will take away the growth momentum of India Inc earnings. After a decline of four months in a row, Indian crude oil basket price surged to $77.88 per barrel in September as against $72.53 per barrel in August. Last year in September, the crude was at $54.52 per barrel. In that sense, in the last one year, crude oil prices have moved up 43 per cent. With the rupee too declining, it became a double whammy. Since the beginning of 2018, Indian crude oil price have gone by 38 per cent in the local currency. Last month, Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in its report suggesting that crude may go to $95 per barrel by the middle of next year. To curtail impact of rising crude oil prices, government post market closing announced cut in excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 per litre and also asked oil marketing companies to absorb under recovery by Rs 1 per litre. The government has also asked state government to reduce their taxes that can help to reduce impact of rising crude oil prices. Government estimates that they would lose revenue of Rs 10500 crore due to this excise cut. There is little clarity how this revenue forgo would impact fiscal deficits. The RBI is most likely to hike the interest rate in tomorrow\u2019s monetary policy review (third hike in the last few months), which has accentuated the worry. The 10-year yield has now moved up to 8.18 per cent, which means the days of cheap money are over. Many corporates have borrowed money in foreign currencies, creating more pressures on their financials. Another effect would be the lower demand, which normally happens when the rate of interest starts rising. While the impact of higher crude oil prices and falling rupee may not be so much visible on the September results, the real impact would be seen in December quarter. Indian market was trading at rich valuation under the assumption that the earnings growth would return, but now that hope is taking a back seat. The Indian stock market\u2014despite the recent fall\u2014continue to trade at 18 times one year forward PE\u2014which is highest among all leading stock markets of the world. This is making the market players nervous.  Some experts also suggest that India may face ire of the US for signing the defence deal with Russia which would mean that India-US relationship may become a casualty. With no clear solution emerging from the ILFS crisis, now many are feeling that LIC may be the next casualty as this institution has been used by the government every now and then to bail out companies, thereby making LIC weaker.  Due to the above mentioned factors, the sentiments are at lowest point since Modi government came to power.  <strong>IPO market now in cold storage</strong> Even IPO market has started feeling the heat of downbeat sentiments as the IPO of Dinesh Engineers has been cancelled due to poor response from the investors, while the recently concluded Aavas Financiers and Garden Reach Shipbuilders just managed to scrape through. Investors will watch carefully whether Aavas lists at premium or discount. With sentiments weak for NBFCs, investors should not expect listing gains on Aavas. For the time being, the IPO market would be in the cold storage.  <strong>Realty index worst performing</strong> When one looks at the indices over the last one month, none of the indices are in the green (including IT), suggesting that this fall is now not restricted to a few sectors or mid-caps or small caps but it is across the board. The red ink is visible everywhere. This shows that, this time around, the bear has spared none. The worst performing index in the last one month is Nifty Realty, which is down by 20 per cent, followed by Small-cap, Telecom and Auto indices.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-917\"src=\"http://credentasset.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/11.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"476\"height=\"319\"/> <strong>Expect Relief Rally</strong> As a long-term strategy, I continue to believe that one should remain invested in quality companies having decent valuations. The way the market has cracked in the last one month, one can expect relief rally, but to expect a sustained rally would be wishful thinking. I would continue to advise portfolio churning, not out of fear, but for fundamental reasons. Rest assured, good quality companies that have taken a beating due to the current weak market sentiments would bounce back once sentiments improve, but one cannot be certain about companies having poor fundamentals and stretched valuations. I have not sold a single share out of fear and continue to hold good quality companies and I would suggest the same to my fellow investors.  <em>The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official VIEW or position of Credent Asset Management.</em> <strong>Sunil Damania </strong>Market Expert &nbsp; <strong>CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate", "slug": "now-heavyweights-are-under-pressure", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/4-oct.jpg"}, {"title": "Tomorrow never comes for India Inc", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/tomorrow-never-comes-for-india-inc/", "content": "Everyone who expected a revival in corporate earnings for the last four or five years is again in for disappointment. Earnings growth for India Inc in FY2019 would be far below the estimates.  This makes our market even more expensive it already is.  The pressure on the margins of India Inc is increasing. The full impact has not been felt yet as the crude price rise and the rupee fall against the dollar happened at the end of August. While the rupee has stabilized, and crude oil prices have cooled off, another danger is the rising interest cost. This looks more stubborn than the crude price rise and falling rupee.  Results for the September quarter are coming in.  They are far from satisfactory. About two third of companies that have declared results saw a decline in their share price post the results. Of course, the decline in share price may not be purely due to quarterly results as the market sentiment is also weak. But the data does convey that results have failed to enthuse the market or stem the weakening sentiments.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-885\"src=\"http://credentasset.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1-1.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"448\"height=\"153\"/> Source: Marketsmojo <strong>India Inc borrowings move up</strong> Common perception is that India Inc in the last few years started deleveraging by selling non-core assets as well as valuable assets to bring down the borrowing cost, but the fact is that the debt of India Inc is on the rise. On the one hand, borrowings have gone up and, on the other, the cost of borrowings have also gone up, delivering a double whammy. The total debt of BSE 500 companies moved up from Rs 24 lac crore in FY2017 to Rs 26 crore lac crore (this excludes banks and financial institutions) in FY18, up by 8 per cent. During the same period, the interest cost for these companies went up by 9 per cent or so.  Till March 2018, the situation was not bad as the RBI had not hiked repo rates. The RBI started increasing interest rates, first on 6<sup>th</sup> June 2018 by 25 basis points and the next on 1<sup>st</sup> August 2018 by another 25 basis points. These two rate hikes have started hurting the profitability of India Inc. The companies that have declared their September quarter results till now saw their YOY (Year-on-Year) interest cost moving up by 35 per cent. And on top of it, the IL&amp;FS crisis pushed up the interest cost further. In October itself, many NBFCs increased their FD rates by 50 basis points. With the US Fed likely to hike rates three more times in 2019, it is highly unlikely that India Inc can expect relief soon on the borrowing cost.  <strong>No longer cheap foreign borrowings</strong> This was about borrowing cost in rupee, but many corporates went outside India to borrow in dollar as the interest rates were very attractive and the rupee was stable. But that equation has also undergone a change as the days of global easy money are over. As per one estimate, 40 per cent of the short-term foreign borrowings are due for repayment by March 2019. This amount will have to be rolled over at a higher cost and the existing loan will have to be repaid at a much higher value in rupee terms. The effect of the same would be felt in the balance sheets in the next six months. Unfortunately, India Inc is in no position to pass on either the higher input costs or the higher borrowing costs to the customers as the demand has gone soft. India\u2019s GDP, which grew at an annual rate of 8.2 per cent in the first quarter of the current financial year, is unlikely to report such higher growth numbers. The rural economy, which was recovering well, has been adversely impacted by unremunerative prices of agricultural produce and poor monsoon. The higher interest rates depress demand and that is exactly what is happening. The sales of cars during Dusshera festive time show that consumer sentiment is not that great.  All in all, there are no <em>Achhe Din</em> in sight for India Inc when it comes to revival in their earnings growth. The right strategy for investors should be to reduce their stakes in companies having higher debt-equity ratio. Also, avoid sectors that are rate sensitive. FMCG companies that normally don\u2019t have borrowings are also not finding favour with the investors due to high valuations and fear of lower volume growth. Probably the rally for the consumer stocks is over. The market is in no mood to pay rich valuation to any company. Many stocks that reported smarter gains in the last five-six years are up for mean reversions. Also, don\u2019t chase stocks that have fallen substantially in the recent past in the hope that these have become attractive. Going by the market movement in the last two months, it looks like the sector preference is undergoing change. Therefore, sectors that led the rally in the past may not lead the next rally. Now is the time is to rebuild the portfolio with new winners and not chase old heroes.  <em>The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official VIEW or position of Credent Asset Management. </em> <strong>Sunil Damania</strong> Market Expert <strong>CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate", "slug": "tomorrow-never-comes-for-india-inc", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/26oct.jpg"}, {"title": "5 Learnings from Warren Buffet for Better Investment Decisions", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/5-learnings-from-warren-buffet-for-better-investment-decisions/", "content": "I don\u2019t need to introduce Warren Buffet to you.

But, unlike the Lord, the market does not forgive those who know not what they do.\u201d He has articulated his investment philosophy in almost all his newsletters and that has not changed! Here goes: We select our marketable equity securities in much the same way we would evaluate a business for acquisition in its entirety. We want the business to be One that we can understand, With favorable long-term prospects, Operated by honest and competent people and Available at a very attractive price.  The confidence in his own thought process is so high that he says \u201cwe are willing to take very large positions in selected companies\u201d. He completely avoids small commitments.  <strong>Learning # 2: Decide your time frame</strong> There are many styles of equity investing. Buy and Hold and Active trading are possibly the two ends of the spectrum. There are enough examples of successful investors in each category, however the key is to know what time frame works for you. Warren Buffet says: \u201cWe make no attempt to predict how security markets will behave; successfully forecasting short term stock price movements is something we think neither we nor anyone else can do. In the longer run, however, we feel that many of our major equity holdings are going to be worth considerably more money than we paid\u201d \u201cWe ordinarily make no attempt to buy equities for anticipated favorable stock price behavior in the short term.\u201d <strong>Learning # 3: Assessing Management Quality</strong> Warren Buffet is very particular about the Quality of Management and the Quality of Business. He says it is better to avoid management that shows itself insensitive to the interests of shareholders. These companies according to him will suffer a long time from relatively lower valuation. Also, a bad management will react badly to situation when the business environment is not favorable. He says, \u201cthe reaction of weak managements to weak operations is often weak accounting\u201d Warren Buffet is very clear on the what financial numbers to use to Assess the quality of management and the business. For example, he says do not put much emphasis on Earnings per Share, instead look at Return on Equity or Return on Capital. To quote him, Earnings per share will rise constantly on a dormant savings account or on a U.S. Savings Bond bearing a fixed rate of return simply because \u201cearnings\u201d (the stated interest rate) are continuously ploughed back and added to the capital base. Thus, even a \u201cstopped clock\u201d can look like a growth stock if the dividend payout ratio is low! Thus, when returns on capital are ordinary, an earn-more-by-putting-up-more record is no great managerial achievement. He also says look at the longer term rather than a one year performance. \u201cWe never take the one-year figure very seriously. After all, why should the time required for a planet to circle the sun synchronize precisely with the time required for business actions to pay off? Instead, we recommend not less than a five-year test as a rough yardstick of economic performance. Red lights should start flashing if the five-year average annual gain falls much below the return on equity earned over the period by American industry in aggregate.\u201d <strong>Learning # 4: The importance of Valuation</strong> Warren Buffet is a stickler for Valuation. He says: \u201cFor the investor, a too-high purchase price for the stock of an excellent company can undo the effects of a subsequent decade of favourable business developments.\u201d In fact, if their business experience continues to satisfy us, we welcome lower market prices of stocks we own as an opportunity to acquire even more of a good thing at a better price. On the other hand he is happy do nothing for as long as valuations are not in his favor. Interestingly the valuation methodology he uses is very industry specific. Here is an interesting example where he says he is ready to pay a higher valuation to a business which has a higher return on capital. \u201cIn some businesses \u2013 a network TV station, for example \u2013 it is virtually impossible to avoid earning extraordinary returns on tangible capital employed in the business. And assets in such businesses sell at equally extraordinary prices, one thousand cents or more on the dollar, a valuation reflecting the splendid, almost unavoidable, economic results obtainable. Despite a fancy price tag, the \u201ceasy\u201d business may be the better route to go.\u201d <strong>Learning # 5: Correcting Mistakes</strong> Even Warren Buffet makes mistakes! Here is an interesting episode that he describes.  \u201cAt the end of 2012 we owned 415 million shares of Tesco, then and now the leading food retailer in the U.K. and an important grocer in other countries as well. Our cost for this investment was $2.3 billion, and the market value was a similar amount.  In 2013, I soured somewhat on the company\u2019s then-management and sold 114 million shares, realizing a profit of $43 million. My leisurely pace in making sales would prove expensive. Charlie calls this sort of behavior \u201cthumb-sucking.\u201d During 2014, Tesco\u2019s problems worsened by the month. The company\u2019s market share fell, its margins contracted and accounting problems surfaced. In the world of business, bad news often surfaces serially: You see a cockroach in your kitchen; as the days go by, you meet his relatives.  We sold Tesco shares throughout the year and are now out of the position. Our after-tax loss from this investment was $444 million\u201d The lesson is very clear, if we make a mistake, we need to correct it as soon as possible. Point to note is that the mistake he described was to do with his assumptions of company fundamentals. The price was not the factor.  There are so many lessons in these letters that one can go on. Please do read these letters and would love to hear your learnings from them.  <strong>Sanjeev Mohta Chief Investment Officer </strong> <a href=\"http://r.marketsmojo.info/mk/cl/-uFxq2os1M0KgZEErOs0NKvwUevbfgWUzakuUIMsNzLgQq6XehJt_tB2nalgrXUw0ppUC_fcmAoQhr0zHG8ABCyUsSFSjPWi8k8QmK9NCcSLFQ\">www.marketsmojo.com</a> <strong> CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate", "slug": "5-learnings-from-warren-buffet-for-better-investment-decisions", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/24Oct.jpg"}, {"title": "Up or Down - Which way will the Sensex head in 2018?", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/up-or-down-which-way-will-the-sensex-head-in-2018/", "content": "During this Dussehra get-together in my society, one of the members asked, \u201cDo you think Sensex will touch 40,000 in 2018?\u201d That made me ponders for a moment. Sensex is presently at 34,800 and from here it has to move up by 15 per cent in the next two-and-half months (by December end) to achieve this level. Two months back, Sensex was very close to 39,000 (highest level of 38989.65 seen in August), just short of 1,000 from that magical figure of 40,000. Hence, it is possible that Sensex can cover this distance in the next two-and-half months. Last week only, we saw Sensex moving up by 1,000 points in three trading days.  But my answer was \u2018No\u2019. And I explained why.  I don\u2019t see Sensex at 40,000. If at all Sensex will have any trajectory for the next two-and-half months, it would be either sideways or downward.  He was not very convinced about my reply as he was of the opinion that Sensex can touch 40,000 in 2018. He cited his reasoning, starting with recent results from TCS, Infosys, HUL, IndusInd Bank and Reliance Industries. Also, the impact of Demonetisation and GST is fading, due to which base effect will kick in. He also believed that since inflation has come under control as per the latest CPI numbers, he argued that RBI will cut interest rate. He also believed that mutual funds for the month of September have seen better inflows over August. That shows that when the market goes down, more money that is waiting on the sidelines will be parked in the mutual funds. He argues: \u201cWhere else would retail investors put their money if not mutual funds? The recent correction in the market has made many stocks attractive, he argued further.  I realised that this guy is not going to leave me unless I give him my reasoning. So here is what I told him.  <strong>Rate cuts ruled out in 2018</strong> I don\u2019t believe that corporate earnings are likely to report better numbers in the second half of the current financial year due to surge in crude oil prices and rupee depreciation. These two factors did not impact in September quarter as they were stable in the first two months of the last quarter. While I do admit the base effect to come in, but headwinds of input costs moving up will impact margins. The rural demand, which everyone believed was coming back, has gone soft in the last few months. This is indicated by the growth in sales volumes of tractors as well as two-wheelers. Even passenger vehicles sales are struggling, suggesting that the demand is not as strong as it used to be. With monsoon below par, it is going to impact demand, especially from rural India \u2013 notwithstanding MSP hikes for many agri commodities. The RBI governor Urjit Patel in a recent post-monetary policy press conference, indicated that a rate cut is not on the table. Going forward, there would be either hike or steady interest rate. The next monetary policy is scheduled on the 5<sup>th</sup> December and hence a rate cut in 2018 is ruled out.  <strong>After 2011, first time FPIs would be net sellers</strong> On the other hand, the valuation of Indian stock market is not at all cheap. The Sensex PE, based on trailing 12-month earnings, is at 22.44 times, very close to the recent high of 25 times. With headwinds on the corporate earnings front and higher interest rates, one should not expect PE to expand. PE could have expanded had liquidity been strong, but that is not the case too. While mutual funds are buyers due to strong inflows, investors of late have become jittery with recent volatility. I do expect slowdown, especially in lump sum investments. I would not be surprised if there is outflow. On the other hand, FPIs have become aggressive in selling. In the first 15 days of October, we have seen outflows of Rs 20125 crore as against the last full month\u2019s outflow of Rs 10800 crore. In 2018, FPIs have sold equity worth Rs 32957 crore. There is no reason for them to turn positive on the Indian equity market, especially when elections are just a few months away. No FPI will commit higher funds when one is not sure which political party is going to form the next government. Right now, the fear is that there would be a coalition government as no single party is likely to get a majority. After 2011, for the first time, the FPIs would be net sellers in the Indian market in a calendar year. If this heavy selling trend continues, then India may see higher outflow than what we saw in 2008 (when the outflow was Rs 53000 crore).  <img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-893\"src=\"http://credentasset.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2-1.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"624\"height=\"373\"/> <strong>40000 by next Dussehra?</strong> Now my member friend got convinced with my argument. It was time for me to pick up my dessert plate and enjoy the ice cream. But he was still not done with his question. He asked me: \u201cDo you think Indian equity market story is over?\u201d I just smiled and informed him that the next time we meet during next Dussehra celebration, Sensex would be higher than the present level. Would it be 40,000 or more? Well, we have several events \u2013 global (tariff wars, China\u2019s situation) and domestic (elections) between now and then which could have an impact. But I see the Sensex higher than it is today.  I could see sparkle on his face. I enjoyed my ice cream and it was time for me to catch up on reading before I hit the bed.  Happy Dussehra to All. Enjoy the festive season and don\u2019t get bothered by short-term volatility. Have a long term view and life would be cool.  <em>The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official VIEW or position of Credent Asset Management.</em> <strong>Sunil Damania </strong>Market Expert &nbsp; <strong>CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate", "slug": "up-or-down-which-way-will-the-sensex-head-in-2018", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/19oct.jpg"}, {"title": "A Red October", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/a-red-october/", "content": "September was a cruel month for the stock market. October is turning out to be worse.  In the first 11 trading days, the Sensex lost 2226 points versus 2400 points over the entire month of September. RBI\u2019s decision not to hike interest rate last Friday did not help (market expected a 25 basis point rate hike).  In the last 45 days, we\u2019ve lost 4600 points and no one knows the bottom for this market.  The ritual technical bounce-back did not happen. The market did show some resilience on Wednesday (10<sup>th</sup> October), but that did not last beyond the day. The market did report gains on Friday but one is not sure about its longevity. Every time investors tried to do bottom-fishing, they burned their fingers. Scrips like DHFL, Infibeam Avenues continue to fall. This trend is bad enough to break investors\u2019 confidence. Bears are in complete control and bulls have been badly mauled.  What was looking cheap is becoming cheaper in this market.  <strong>International factors impacting sentiments</strong> Till Wednesday, Indian stock market faced pressure from domestic problems like the IL&amp;FS crisis and its spillover effect, high crude oil prices and a falling rupee.  On Thursday, that changed. Even the international angle got added. The US stock indices fell severely creating a global panic and India too felt the tremors. A double whammy for Indian investors.  Another factor:  the market is worried about is the pledge of shares, not just by the promoters, but by high net worth investors (HNIs). Lenders are asking for extra margin and in case they are unable to provide the same, they are selling the shares. In some instances, HNIs have provided extra margin by selling blue chip stocks, which has built pressure on the even the blue chip companies. Reliance in the month of October (till 11<sup>th</sup> October) was down by 15.5 per cent and so is the case with TCS, which is down by 9.40 per cent. The IT sector, which gave handsome returns to the investors in 2018, is now facing great headwinds mainly due to pressure on IT stocks in the US and profit-booking by investors to meet losses in other sectors.  <strong>Dark clouds on the MF front</strong> Fortunately, so far, the Indian mutual fund industry has continued to receive good inflows from investors. Data released by AMFI suggests that September month saw net inflows of Rs 11982 crore \u2013 almost double as compared to August 2018 figure of Rs 5923 crore. This was mainly due to lump sump investments rather than SIPs. MF investors deployed capital in September, thinking that valuations have become attractive, but the market fall in October has created fear. I suspect that lump sump investments will now take a back seat and expect net outflows on the lump sum investments front. SIP investments, which are averaging around Rs 7000 crore every month, may also decline as there are reports that many investors have made requests for pausing their SIPs. Usually, it takes one month to stop SIP and the real effect would be felt in the month of October.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-897\"src=\"http://credentasset.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/3-1.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"298\"height=\"234\"/> Till now, Indian mutual funds have been buyers in the market when the FIIs have been sellers. In 2018, the net outflow by the FIIs has been Rs 28397 crore, while mutual funds have pumped in Rs 92000 crore. If mutual fund inflows slow down, it will have a telling impact on the indices.  <strong>Earnings pressures:</strong> These are early days for quarterly results, but the market this time is not interested in the September numbers, but it is more interested in how the management is looking at the future. TCS came out with decent numbers with topline growth of 8 per cent (QoQ) and bottomline growth of\u20147.5 per cent and yet scrip went down on Friday. The fear is now increasing that December numbers would be bad for India Inc due to higher input costs and lower demand growth, creating topline as well as bottomline pressures on the companies\u2019 financials. Indian market commanded higher price to earnings (P/E) ratio on the hope of higher earnings growth. With doubts on earnings growth, the stock market would find it difficult to justify the kind of premium valuation it is commanding today.  <strong>V shape recovery ruled out</strong> Hope is the fuel of the markets. Everyone expects a V-shaped recovery after such a sharp fall. I have a feeling that the recovery would be slow and would be a U-shaped one. If for any reason the Sensex shows smart uptrend, don\u2019t get excited. It may not sustain for long as we experienced on Thursday. I have a feeling that the market at some point would try to settle at lower levels and then have a much slower and gradual recovery. I would prefer 100 points daily gain rather than 500 points-a-day rally. That would make the base much stronger.  Right now, we are far off from the recovery point. While many stocks in the recent fall have become attractive, my advice would be to buy quality stocks (refer our Mojo stocks) in a staggered manner. If you wish to buy 1,000 shares of a company, then buy 200 shares in five lots. This market is not running away in a hurry and one would get enough opportunities to invest in quality companies. At reasonable prices. It is a challenging time for equity investors and those who can survive in such challenging times would make handsome gains when the tide turns. Time is to keep calm and remain composed and not let fear control your emotions.  <strong>Tough times don\u2019t last, but tough investors do.</strong> <em>The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official VIEW or position of Credent Asset Management.</em> <strong>Sunil Damania </strong>Market Expert &nbsp; <strong>CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate", "slug": "a-red-october", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/12-oct.jpg"}, {"title": "DuPont Analysis: A Great Tool to Compare Companies", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/dupont-analysis-a-great-tool-to-compare-companies/", "content": "To make investing decisions, many a times we want to compare the business models of companies in one sector to understand if we can explain the differences in valuation and also which company has better financial metrics.  Let me take an example, Dabur India and Godrej Consumer have been two big \u201cMade in India\u201d success stories in the FMCG sector, a sector which has been dominated by global giants such as Unilever and P&amp;G. It would be interesting to compare these two amazing companies.  <strong>The Market Cap of the two companies are very similar</strong> As the table below shows, the stock market has been recognizing the potential of these companies and the 10 year price returns of these two companies are far higher than that of Hindustan Unilever and the overall market.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-902\"src=\"http://credentasset.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/4.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"700\"height=\"162\"/> After this phenomenal performance over the past few years, Interestingly the Current Market Cap of these two companies is very similar.  <strong>Two companies, two different approaches</strong> These two companies with long legacies of more than 120+ years each have taken different paths to achieve success. Dabur describes itself as \u201cOne of the Best Ayurvedic Companies in India\u201d whereas Godrej calls itself the \u201cLargest home-grown home and personal care company in India.\u201d <strong>But, Both have global ambitions</strong> Dabur\u2019s products are today available in over 120 countries across the globe. Dabur\u2019s overseas revenue today accounts for over 30% of the total turnover. While Godrej is largest household insecticide and hair care players in emerging markets. In household insecticides, they are the leader in India, the second largest player in Indonesia and are now expanding our footprint in Africa. They are the leader in hair extensions in Africa, the number one player in hair color in India and Sub-Saharan Africa and among the leading players in Latin America. They are the number one player in air fresheners and wet tissues in Indonesia.  <strong>Both Have a Large and Diverse Portfolio</strong> Dabur today operates in key consumer product categories like Hair Care, Oral Care, Health Care, Skin Care, Home Care and Foods.  Dabur India has portfolio of over 250 Herbal/Ayurvedic products. Dabur\u2019s FMCG portfolio today includes five flagship brands with distinct brand identities \u2014 Dabur as the master brand for natural healthcare products, Vatika for premium personal care, Hajmola for digestives, R\u00e9al for fruit juices and beverages and Fem for fairness bleaches and skin care products.  Godrej Consumer\u2019s products include soap, hair colourants, toiletries and liquid detergents. Its brands include \u2018Cinthol\u2019, \u2018Godrej Fair Glow\u2019, \u2018Godrej No.1\u2019 and \u2018Godrej Shikakai\u2019 in soaps, \u2018Godrej Powder Hair Dye\u2019, \u2018Renew\u2019, \u2018ColourSoft\u2019 in hair colourants and \u2018Ezee\u2019 liquid detergent.  <strong>How do the Financials of these two companies stack up?</strong> A very interesting tool to compare the business model of two companies in similar businesses is the DuPont Analysis.  <strong>What is DuPont Analysis?</strong> The genesis of the analysis was a framework developed by the DuPont Corporation of the USA. DuPont analysis is great measure of fundamental performance of a company. This analysis decomposes the key drivers of Return on Equity (ROE). ROE is one of the most important measures of a company\u2019s profitability.  Return on Equity = Net Profit Margin x Asset Turnover Ratio x Financial Leverage Where, <ul> <li>Net Profit Margin = (Net Income / Sales)</li> </ul> The Net Profit Margin signifies the Profit that is extracted per rupee of Sales. Everything else remaining same, a company which has a higher Net Profit Margin has a higher ROE.  <ul> <li>Asset Turnover Ratio = (Sales / Total Assets)</li> </ul> This ratio is an efficiency measurement used to determine how effectively a company uses its assets to generate revenue. Higher the Asset Turnover Ratio, higher the ROE, everything else remaining the same.  <ul> <li>Financial Leverage = (Total Assets / Total Equity)</li> </ul> Financial Leverage measure whether a company finances the purchase of assets primarily through debt or equity. The higher the Financial Leverage the higher the ROE. Financial Leverage when it becomes excessive can increase the risk of bankruptcy.  <strong>So, what does the Dupont Analysis tells us for Dabur and Godrej?</strong> Here are the numbers: <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-903\"src=\"http://credentasset.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/5.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"700\"height=\"355\"/> The ROEs of Godrej is 300 bps higher than Dabur\u2019s. So one would think that Godrej has better Financial metrics.  However, a Deeper look at the Dupont Analysis reveals a different story.  While the Net Profit Margins for the two companies are similar, Dabur utilises its assets better than Godrej Consumer as can be seen in the Asset Turnover Ratio of Dabur at 1.25 vs Godrej at 1.02 Also, Godrej\u2019s ROE is enhanced by taking a higher Financial Leverage.  So in effect, Dabur has better financial metrics than Godrej.  <strong>In general, the Stock Market gives a higher Valuation to a company which has better Financial Metrics.</strong> Thus, it should not come as a surprise that the Valuation of Dabur with a P/E of 54.2 x is higher than that of Godrej who has a P/E of 49x!  This analysis was just to highlight the simplicity of Dupont Analysis and its power. For a more meaningful research one needs to do a longer-term analysis. One year is not enough.  Would love to hear your thoughts and any additional analysis that you may have done.  <strong>Sanjeev Mohta Chief Investment Officer </strong> <a href=\"http://r.marketsmojo.info/mk/cl/6MuUij5yQiAx2_p6Y0QuityJ3GGDSB-aEbKNX38MbeCaZ4EyqmB5bVjC58AxhYfLyfLE2acaBlgbcSt5H8CfgNqFu6Blvd3mDPuOIKHRLZ5gig\">www.marketsmojo.com</a> &nbsp; <strong>CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate", "slug": "dupont-analysis-a-great-tool-to-compare-companies", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/10-oct.jpg"}, {"title": "The Short-Term Pain Points: No End in Sight?", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/the-short-term-pain-points-no-end-in-sight/", "content": "The Indian Market has been going through some pain since the beginning of the year and the last quarter has been no different.  <img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-912\"src=\"http://credentasset.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/6.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"367\"height=\"325\"/> Also, as highlighted in the piece, <a href=\"http://r.marketsmojo.info/mk/cl/fAd6PgVlVvFCyX2uHQYhQakxcAKA12za_sSTjndefUH33aNfMe6gTRVfQbc9FkT7ZS9kTmASDAqkxuQyl8rtA0MVG22m1rxNV1goZJxjIjkO3g\"><strong>Will the Underperformance of Smaller Stocks Continue?</strong></a> The Story continues to be a tale of two markets where the Small and Mid-Cap companies are seeing much more pain than the large cap ones.  <img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-913\"src=\"http://credentasset.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/7.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"562\"height=\"383\"/> *All Indices are rebased to 100 on Jan 1, 2o18 for like to like comparison <strong>The Pain Points have largely been the same</strong> Most of the pain points remain the ones highlighted in the Last quarter report, <strong>6 Factors that will impact the Market in the near term.</strong> The Global Economy continues to be strong putting upward pressure on the US interest rates and keeping the USD very strong.

These results will be closely monitored as the General Elections will take place in First half of 2019.  Unfortunately, the <strong>Public Sector Bank Loan issues</strong> are also largely unresolved. The government did announce a merger of Bank of Baroda with Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank to try to address some of the issues going forward but the issues cannot be solved in a hurry.  <strong>Valuation</strong> of the large cap stocks continue to be high as they have not fallen off much. This will continue to provide headwind in a market which is jittery.  And there is a new problem.  <strong>Liquidity has been the New Problem</strong> The additional factor, which was not anticipated, has been the Liquidity issues facing the Debt market which is causing its own pain. The problem was exaggerated due to the issues facing IL&amp;FS.  On September 8, Economic Times reported that \u201cICRA downgrades IL&amp;FS by several notches\u201d IL&amp;FS\u2019s non-convertible debentures and commercial paper were downgraded to junk after it missed repayment to Small Industries Development Bank of India Ltd.  On September 18, Moody\u2019s Investor Services said that \u201crising liquidity worries at ailing IL&amp;FS are credit negative for banks and debt market.\u201d The liquidity issues translated into the stock market worrying about the Finance companies. Especially those which have Assets which are long duration but Liabilities which are short duration. Infrastructure Finance and Housing Finance companies typically fall under this category.  The stock prices of some of the Housing Finance companies have taken a huge hit in September.  <img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-911\"src=\"http://credentasset.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/10.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"595\"height=\"397\"/> On Liquidity, the good news is that RBI has acted fast. They said \u201cReserve Bank stands ready to meet the durable liquidity requirements of the system through various available instruments depending on its dynamic assessment of the evolving liquidity and market conditions.\u201d <strong>Where is the market heading?</strong> Like I said last time, the state of the economy or politics are very difficult to predict and so is the Market. Based on the data and other evidence one can only try and make a judgement.  The good news is that many stocks are now looking attractive after the sharp correction. Also if the growth momentum continues for the economy and for the companies the investment case will become more compelling.  However, the bad news is that for most of the pain points there is no clear visibility in sight. Till these issues are resolved the market may continue to remain difficult. In that situation, at best it will remain a stock picker\u2019s market at for the next few months.  <em>The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official VIEW or position of Credent Asset Management.</em> <strong>Sanjeev Mohta Chief Investment Officer </strong> <a href=\"http://r.marketsmojo.info/mk/cl/XSfkmbqrJNd52VOgwyedlXU3kb5F3V0DE-pkaPVkoGH3MyWFVecQaIe1B_GGWHO9947A_O4TNMdSpdhEk1pUmxK3Bk0-8GYNT9hkvzUm2j7DqJM\">www.marketsmojo.com</a> &nbsp; <strong>CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate", "slug": "the-short-term-pain-points-no-end-in-sight", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/5thoct.jpg"}, {"title": "What will happen if BJP loses three key states on 11th December?", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/what-will-happen-if-bjp-loses-three-key-states-on-11th-december/", "content": "Many investors are concerned about the impact the state assembly elections will have on the stock market. There are five states where the election process is underway and the results of all these states would be declared on 11<sup>th</sup> December. The exit polls of all five states would be announced on 7<sup>th</sup> December as polling in Rajasthan as well as Telangana would be over on that day. The poll outcomes of the three states \u2013 Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh \u2013 would be closely watched by the markets. All these three states are presently ruled by the BJP governments, of which two states \u2013 MP and Chhattisgarh \u2013 have been ruled for three consecutive terms, and if re-elected, it would be a fourth win in a row \u2013 a record of sorts. But the BJP need to overcome the huge anti-incumbency factor to win this time around. On the other hand, Rajasthan has seen alternate terms (since 1993) for the BJP and the Congress at every assembly election. Since the BJP is in saddle now, this time the assumption is that the Congress will win the election. Going by the body language of the BJP leaders, it does give an indication that they are not too optimistic on Rajasthan. The stock market is looking at various possibilities, ranging from BJP losing all the three states to winning one or two, to winning all three.  Let\u2019s try and assess the impact each scenario could have on the stock market.  History is a great guide. Past trends help us crystal gaze on what could be the future impact. Let us assume that the first probability of BJP losing all the three states comes to pass. The immediate reaction in the market would be a downward move, as such an outcome would create some doubt about whether the Modi government would be able to retain power in the next general elections. But will this downward trend continue beyond a day? To answer that, I have looked at two market reactions when BJP did poorly in state assembly elections.  Let us start with Delhi state assembly elections of February 2015. The election took place less than a year after the spectacular victory of the BJP in the general elections in May 2014. Most of the exit polls did give an indication that AAP will get a majority, but no one could predict that AAP would sweep the polls, winning 67 out of a total of 70 seats, with the BJP just managing to win three seats and the Congress scoring a duck. The market did not react negatively, despite the BJP\u2019s poor show. The Sensex lost 491 points, it recouped the entire loss in a couple of days. Look at the table below.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-933\"src=\"https://credentasset.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/11.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"700\"height=\"206\"/> Now let\u2019s check the Bihar elections, where again the BJP did not fare well. On 8<sup>th</sup> November 2015, when the results started coming in, it was a clear victory for the alliance that consisted of JD-U, RJD and the Congress, with the alliance winning 178 seats out of a total of 243 seats. But the market hardly moved post the results, suggesting that the BJP losing Bihar election evoked no negative sentiments in the market.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-925\"src=\"https://credentasset.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"698\"height=\"185\"/> These two examples give a clear indication that if BJP for some reason loses all the three states, the impact on the stock market may not be significant. If at all the market sentiments get impacted, it would be a one or two day affair. Even that impact would not be more than 500-800 points on the downside. Nowadays, 500-point movement has become normal, even without elections.  Now let us look at the possibility of the BJP winning all the three states. Will this spur the Sensex upward? For this, I have taken the example of Uttar Pradesh assembly election results, where the BJP did extremely well. The UP assembly election took place last year in March 2017. The BJP surprised with a resounding victory as it won 312 out of 403 seats. But the market did not see any sustained rally. So even if the BJP wins 3-0, don\u2019t expect any rally in the market.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-926\"src=\"https://credentasset.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"700\"height=\"189\"/> Now what happens if BJP wins 2-1 or 1-2? In this kind of scenario too, don\u2019t expect any major movement on either side.  Investors must understand that the market has no liking for any political party, be it BJP or Congress. Market reacted negatively to the same Congress when it came in power in 2004 and gave a thumbs up in 2009 election. The same way, the market rallied in anticipation of BJP coming to power in 2014 election.  What market care about are earnings and liquidity. These two trends decide the long-term trajectory of the market. Election results may come and go, but that\u2019s not going to change the trajectory of the market.  Hence don\u2019t wait for the election results to invest. Investing is all about buying quality companies at the right valuation. <em>Don\u2019t attempt to time the market with election results.</em> It is a little premature to speculate the impact that these state assembly elections will have on the general elections next year,. In politics, six months is a long time. Voters\u2019 mood can change in six months. Remember, the BJP government at the Centre preponed the general elections to May 2004 after winning the state assembly elections in MP, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh thinking that voters are with them. The rest is history, as voters\u2019 mood had changed by then. Also, the voters\u2019 trend in assembly elections and general elections are normally different as assembly elections are fought on local issues, while the general elections are contested on national issues. Right now, the market is expecting Modi to get re-elected in the next general elections, but with a reduced majority. But the market is entitled to change its view by the time the general elections approach.  P.S.: <em>My prediction is that the BJP will win MP and Chhattisgarh and there will be a nail-biting finish in Rajasthan.</em> <em>The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official VIEW or position of Credent Asset Management Services Pvt Ltd. </em> <strong>Sunil Damania</strong> Market Expert <strong>CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate", "slug": "what-will-happen-if-bjp-loses-three-key-states-on-11th-december", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/28N.jpg"}, {"title": "Death Traps or Great Buys? Are aviation stocks safe?", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/death-traps-or-great-buys-are-aviation-stocks-safe/", "content": "<strong>Aviation stocks have been on an uptrend, but could these stocks be \"death-traps\"for investors?</strong> Jet Airways is up by 35 per cent in one month, Interglobe Aviation by 25 per cent and Spicejet by 11 per cent. Sensex was up by 3 per cent. This outperformance was despite all the three companies reporting massive losses for the quarter ended September 2018. So, is this rise sustainable or is it due for correction?  Historically, the aviation stocks never made money for the investors. The first aviation company to go public was Damania Airways. This company later shut shop. The second aviation company to tap the market was East West Airlines and that company also met with similar fate. Many airlines started business only to close down or sell it to competitors as the business was not viable. In the process, investors lost money big time. Famous investor Warren Buffett once made a statement that the aviation sector is a \u201cdeath trap\u201d for investors. This is true at least in India, even though Buffett was not referring to Indian aviation stocks but based his opinion on his personal experience, where he had invested in 1989 in a company called US Air. Buffett changed his opinion about the sector in 2016 and committed fresh investments in four US-based aviation companies with substantial stake in each one-Delta Airlines, Southwest Airlines, United Continental and American Airlines. Since Buffett\u2019s investment horizon is for the long term, it would be a little too early to say whether he would exit with profit or loss. But, in one of the interviews this year, he announced that he is not ruling out owning an airline, suggesting that he is bullish on the aviation sector.  Back to India. Interglobe Airline did raise some hopes that aviation stocks can give you good capital appreciation due to its operational excellence and increasing market share. But this initial hope did not sustain for long, despite some of the Indian marquee investors betting on the company\u2019s well-managed operations. Spicejet, which was almost on the verge of going the Kingfisher way, was bailed out by Ajay Singh. The company has turned around financially under the new management and so has its share price. But this trend did not last long for both Interglobe as well as Spicejet, as both the stocks are down by 12 per cent and 45 per cent, respectively, in the last one year, as against the benchmark index, which is up by 6 per cent. Even the last three-year returns from both these stocks are not that great as both have underperformed the broader indices. I am not talking about Jet as it was struggling to get investors\u2019 attention for many years in a row, and now is up on talks to sell their aviation business to the Tata\u2019s.  I have reasons not to be bullish on these companies. First, the past track record of the industry does not inspire much confidence. Second, this industry lacks discipline. A new player can force existing players to reduce prices to a level that are so unremunerative that the entire industry bleeds. Third, this industry has seen leaders changing very often. When private airlines entered the segment, Indian Airlines (which later merged with Air India) was the leader. Then Jet Airways overtook Air India. Later Kingfisher emerged as the leader overtaking Jet. Now Indigo (Interglobe Aviation) is the market leader. This trend shows high competitive pressure. Some of the successful industries where investors have made tonnes of money have seen no churn in leadership for a long period of time. Take the paint industry, where Asian Paints has been a leader for a very long time. Or, take FMCG, where Hindustan Unilever is the overall leader, or the toothpaste category, where Colgate is a leader. Take cars, where Maruti is a leader. So, the industry where leadership changes very often turns out to be painful for the investors. The latest example is telecom, where Jio\u2019s entry saw change in leadership again. No need to say that investors lost money big time.  Four, the aviation sector\u2019s expenses are driven by global factors which are beyond the industry\u2019s control. The ATF (Aviation Turbine Fuel) and rupee value against dollar are big cost factors that can turn a profitable company into a loss-making one. Interglobe Aviation\u2019s massive loss of Rs 652 crore for the quarter ended September 2018 is mainly due to higher fuel cost. The management has said that almost 50 per cent change in the company\u2019s fortunes was due to higher fuel cost and the remaining was due to fall in the value of the rupee against the dollar and the falling yields on the airline ticket prices. The price of ATF in the last one year increased from Rs 50 to Rs 70 per litre for the quarter ended September 2018, but the airline industry could not pass on this hike to the customers. One is not sure about the trajectory of the crude oil prices going forward. But that is not the only challenge. Other challenge is that the government is not comfortable with some of the business practices of the industry, such as no refund to customers if they want to cancel tickets or want to change their travel schedule. The government also wants this industry to pay refund with penalty in case the flight gets cancelled. In a nutshell, this industry does not enjoy confidence of the government. At the same time, I don\u2019t see competitive pressures easing soon.  I think this industry cannot create long term capital appreciation for the investors. Some investors do get lured by the M&amp;A activity in the industry, but the M&amp;A scrip runs up too fast and not many are able to buy at lower prices. By the time one buys it, it is normally the top price for months to come. Warren Buffett was right when he said aviation stocks are \u201cdeath-traps\u201d for the investors, even though he was not referring to the Indian aviation stocks.  <em>The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official VIEW or position of Credent Asset Management Services Pvt Ltd</em> <strong>Sunil Damania</strong> Market Expert <strong>CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate", "slug": "death-traps-or-great-buys-are-aviation-stocks-safe", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/22N.jpg"}, {"title": "As stocks trade below IPO price, what are lessons for investors", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/as-stocks-trade-below-ipo-price-what-are-lessons-for-investors/", "content": "Two generations of Indian investors have propagated the myth that you can never lose money in an IPO. As a result, people have been dipping into their savings and apply for IPOs thinking they have nothing to lose. 2018 is proving them wrong.  The year 2018 is turning out to be a bad year for the IPO market. Out of 24 companies that went public, as many as 17 are quoting below their offer price. This kind of performance does not inspire promoters who are waiting in the wings to tap the IPO market as they are not sure whether they can manage to get even full subscription, forget about over subscription. The way things are looking now, the IPO market will raise much lesser amount in 2018 as compared to the amount of Rs 68826 crore raised in 2017.  No company came out with an IPO in the month of October. The last issue was from Garden Reach Shipbuilders which opened on 24<sup>th</sup> September but struggled to get even full subscription. It managed to eventually scrape through, thanks to the issue being kept open longer than initially planned and a marginal decrease in the price band. No need to say that it is quoting at 24 per cent discount to its offer price.  As on 2<sup>nd</sup> November 2018 (latest updated data available on SEBI\u2019s website), there are 32 offer documents waiting for SEBI\u2019s approval (about 30/35 more companies have got approval, but are waiting for the right time to tap the market). Last month, only three offer documents were filed with SEBI, but in September the documents filed were as high as 19. This shows the level of activity in the primary market.  &nbsp; <strong>Greed of promoters and merchant bankers</strong> Time and again it has been observed that promoters and merchant bankers go overboard on the pricing of the IPO, not leaving much on the table for the investors, especially when the market sentiment is bullish. What is surprising is that many of the anchor investors invest in these companies at higher prices. One wonders what kind of valuation matrix these investors follow that justifies their subscription. One may argue that the stock prices of many of the companies in the secondary market have also collapsed, and if so, the fall in the stock prices of IPO companies is no big deal.  But I don\u2019t agree with this argument. The primary market is much different from the secondary market. First, in the primary market, there is no supply as no one holds shares on the first day of trading, except those who have been allotted. Hence, every investor\u2019s buying price is the same as the IPO price. Then, how does one explain the scrip quoting below the offer price on the first day? What is the incentive for someone to sell at a loss? Second, the floating stock is limited as the anchor investors as well as promoters (including those who are holding shares before the IPO) carry lock-in period. That restricts supply. The company, while going public, would have done many roadshows. These roadshows help in price discovery. If so, how come the price discovery could be so much off the target? How does one explain share price falling by as much as 50 per cent in a few months from listing? Let us take the case of Apollo Microsystem, which is down by 51 per cent since listing. ICICI Securities is also down by more than 50 per cent. One can understand if there is negative news about the company post the listing, but that is not the case with the two companies mentioned above. This so-called price discovery is nothing but the greed of the promoters and the merchant bankers. They don\u2019t realise that their myopic thinking not only impacts their brand equity, but also the prospects of companies who are waiting to come out with an IPO.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-930\"src=\"https://credentasset.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/4.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"585\"height=\"349\"/> <strong>Primary market gives idea about the next fall</strong> Another area where I don\u2019t agree with the general perception is that the secondary market decides the IPO market trend. On the contrary, I would say that the primary market gives an indication of what is in store in the secondary market. If a few IPOs in a row start quoting below their offer price, it gives a clear indication that the secondary market is due for correction. It gives an indication that the investors are in no mood to pay higher valuations. The last four issues that got listed and quoted below their offer price did indicate that the secondary market has formed a temporary top. Something similar happened in 2008 too when the Indian stock market was booming. At that time, Reliance Power came out with a mega IPO but it started quoting below the offer price. The secondary market then corrected substantially. So, keep a close watch on the primary market to make money in the secondary market.  <strong>Do they merit buying at lower price?</strong> Many investors must be wondering that since many IPOs are quoting below their offer prices, does it not make sense to buy them? My advice would be to have stock-specific approach. There could be a reason why the company is commanding that kind of valuation. There is a high probability that the companies that have fallen may fall more. What has been observed time and again is that the IPOs of quality promoters have given manifold returns to the investors. Take Godrej or Tata or HDFC. Whenever companies from these groups went public, they have created huge wealth for the investors. Despite weak sentiments, HDFC AMC continues to trade above the offer price, which shows that investments in quality companies give you smart returns as compared with the poorly managed companies. What matters in the stock market\u2014primary or secondary\u2014is buying quality companies at reasonable valuations. If these two conditions are met, your probability of making money on the stock market goes up.

Written by American author Edwin Lef\u00e8vre, it is said to be a partly fictionalized biography of the legendary trader, Jesse Livermore. Even today, many successful traders/speculators who I know treat this book as their Bible.  Unlike the success stories of Investors like Warren Buffet, the most interesting part of Livermore\u2019s story is that he made and lost fortunes many times over in his career. All these experiences that are recorded in the book have great lessons for not only those who like to trade/speculate  in the market but also for investors.  If you have not read the book I would highly recommend it.  <strong>Here are 10  lessons from the book  that are extremely useful.</strong> <ol> <li><strong> Investing is hard work</strong></li> </ol> \u201cPeople who look for easy money invariably pay for the privilege of proving conclusively that it cannot be found on this sordid earth.\u201d <ol start=\"2\"> <li><strong>It is important to recognize who you are\u2026. Speculator or Investor</strong></li> </ol> \u201cA man must know himself thoroughly if he is going to make a good job out of trading in the speculative markets. To know what I was capable of in the line of folly was a long educational step. I sometimes think that no price is too high for a speculator to pay to learn that which will keep him from getting the swelled head.\u201d \u201cSpeculators buy the trend; investors are in for the long haul; \u201cthey are a different breed of cats.\u201d One reason that people lose money today is that they have lost sight of this distinction; they profess to have the long term in mind and yet cannot resist following where the hot money has led.\u201d <ol start=\"3\"> <li><strong> History, Experience and Mistakes are the best teachers</strong></li> </ol> \u201cAnother lesson I learned early is that there is nothing new in Wall Street. There can\u2019t be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market to-day has happened before and will happen again. I\u2019ve never forgotten that. I suppose I really manage to remember when and how it happened. The fact that I remember that way is my way of capitalizing experience.\u201d \u201cFear and hope remain the same; therefore the study of the psychology of speculators is as valuable as it ever was. Weapons change, but strategy remains strategy, on the New York Stock Exchange as on the battlefield. I think the clearest summing up of the whole thing was expressed by Thomas F. Woodlock when he declared: \u201cThe principles of successful stock speculation are based on the supposition that people will continue in the future to make the mistakes that they have made in the past.\u201d \u201cIf a man didn\u2019t make mistakes he\u2019d own the world in a month. But if he didn\u2019t profit by his mistakes he wouldn\u2019t own a blessed thing.\u201d <ol start=\"4\"> <li><strong> Ignorance, Greed, Fear and Hope are the 4 deadly sins</strong></li> </ol> The speculator\u2019s deadly enemies are: Ignorance, greed, fear and hope.  All the statue books in the world and all the rule books on all the Exchanges of the earth cannot eliminate these from the human animal.  <ol start=\"5\"> <li><strong> Uncertainty &amp; Indecision are harmful for your financial health</strong></li> </ol> \u201cA man cannot be convinced against his own convictions, but he can be talked into a state of uncertainty and indecision, which is even worse, for that means that he cannot trade with confidence and comfort.\u201d <ol start=\"6\"> <li><strong> Do not average your losses</strong></li> </ol> \u201cI did precisely the wrong thing. The cotton showed me a loss and I kept it. The wheat showed me a profit and I sold it out. Of all the speculative blunders there are few greater than trying to average a losing game. Always sell what shows you a loss and keep what shows you a profit.\u201d <ol start=\"7\"> <li><strong> If you are wrong cut your losses</strong></li> </ol> \u201cLosing money is the least of my troubles.  A loss never troubles me after I take it.  I forget it overnight.  But being wrong \u2013 not taking the loss \u2013 that is what does the damage to the pocket book and to the soul.\u201d <ol start=\"8\"> <li><strong> Let your Position not dictate your view</strong></li> </ol> When I am long of stocks it is because my reading of conditions has made me bullish.  But you find many people, reputed to be intelligent, who are bullish because they have stocks.  I do not allow my possessions \u2013 or my prepossessions either \u2013 to do any thinking for me.  That is why I repeat that I never argue with the tape.  <ol start=\"9\"> <li><strong> Sometimes it is important to do nothing</strong></li> </ol> \u201cThe desire for constant action irrespective of underlying conditions is responsible for many losses in Wall Street even among the professionals, who feel that they must take home some money every day, as though they were working for regular wages.\u201d <ol start=\"10\"> <li><strong> Do not plan your expenses based on your potential Trading Profits</strong></li> </ol> There isn\u2019t a man on Wall Street who has not lost money trying to make the market pay for an automobile or a bracelet or a motor boat or a painting.  <em>Wish you a very Happy Festive Season</em> <strong>Sanjeev Mohta</strong> CIO - Marketsmojo.com &nbsp; <strong>CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate", "slug": "10-lessons-from-reminiscences-of-a-stock-operator", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2N.jpg"}, {"title": "Not buying Gold on Dhanteras?", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/not-buying-gold-on-dhanteras/", "content": "Gold prices move in cycles. Bull and bear cycles like any other asset class. And there is no guarantee of steady returns.  We Indians love gold. And we\u2019ve done so for centuries. This is the time of the year that families make their way to their jewelers.  And we believe that gold <em>always</em> appreciates. That it is a good investment. That it is safer than to other asset classes.  But that\u2019s not true. Never was.  Gold prices move in cycles. Bull and bear cycles like any other asset class. And there is no guarantee of steady returns. The last gold bull cycle started in 2001 and ended in 2012. Before that, gold moved in a narrow range from 1988 to 2001. In 1988, the average price of gold was Rs 3130 per 10 gram and in 2001 it was Rs 4300, giving merely 37 per cent absolute return in 13 years. Had you invested in Bank Fixed Deposits you would have been better off. This data busts the myth that gold offers inflation-beating returns. It doesn\u2019t. Of course, gold did move higher in-between, but that move did not sustain for a long period.  When gold started moving up in 2001, it went up by 7 times in 11 years and this Bull Run ended in 2012. Since, gold has not given meaningful returns despite the rupee decline during the same period.  India is a price-taker for gold. Indian gold prices are aligned to global movements. Internationally, gold prices peaked at $1900 per ounce in 2011 and are presently trading at $1229 per ounce. Gold did not touch $1900 per ounce level in the last six years, suggesting that if you bought it at high levels did not move out with profit. So let\u2019s remove the notion that gold always gives positive returns.  So, should you buy gold this festive season? My answer is YES, but only for auspicious reason and not as an investment. If you believe tradition \u2013 buying gold on an auspicious day like <em>Dhan Teras</em> brings prosperity. During festive times, gold prices move up due to higher demand. It was Rs 3059 per gm during September-end and presently it is at Rs 3183, up by four per cent in a month. Once the season is over, gold prices will come down.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-924\"src=\"https://credentasset.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/5.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"294\"height=\"237\"/> Now, should you buy gold for investment purpose at all? Well, again my answer is Yes. I feel that the downside is low, but the upside could be in the region of 11-12 per cent in the next one year. Based on my observation over of many years, the best time to buy gold for investment is in December. That\u2019s the time when gold prices are soft. Hence wait for one more month before buying gold for investment purpose.  <strong>Reason:</strong> Gold has moved in a narrow range in the last few years. As explained earlier, gold moves in cycles. I have a feeling that the downside cycle of gold is over. It should start inching up in a slow manner. 2019 could be the beginning of the next bull cycle. I expect gold should be in the region of $1325-1350 per ounce by the end of 2019.  Almost eight percent up from the present level. In India, the price of gold is the function of rupee-dollar rate. In the last 12 months, the rupee has depreciated steeply and it is unlikely that we will see more pressure on the rupee for the next 12 months. My sense is that the rupee may depreciate by 3-4 per cent or so by December 2019. That means, the total return from gold could be in the region of 11-12 per cent. Not a bad return for the investors, given the volatility and uncertainty in other asset classes. Also, investment in gold should be a part of one\u2019s asset allocation strategy.  Another reason, for my bullishness: the US stock market is at its peak \u2013 enjoying an extended bull run (9 years on the trot). A correction in the US equity market will push investors towards gold. There is a possibility of the US economic growth peaks out by the second-half of 2019, which can force the Fed to rethink its strategy on rate hikes. Slowly, the \u201crisk-off\u201d strategy is coming back, which augurs well for gold. In the last few years, new investment avenues like Bitcoin and other crypto currencies competed with gold for a share of investors\u2019 investment bucket, thereby impacting fresh inflows into gold. Now, crypto currencies have lost their charm. Bitcoin, which was at $14000 at the end of December 2017, is today trading at $6334. With crypto currencies going out of fashion, gold should be the direct beneficiary.  <strong>A few things that can go wrong:</strong> Gold price movements and US Fed rate hikes have a strong negative correlation. The Fed is expected to continue with rate hikes, which may not augur well for gold. Another risk is that the Chinese economy is slowing down. And finally, the deficient monsoon in India can soften that the demand for gold in rural India. India and China account for 60 per cent of the global demand for gold jewellery.  <strong>A line of caution:</strong> Normally, people get confused with investment in gold with investment in jewellery. Investment in jewellery is the worst investment one can make. People don\u2019t realize that jewellery includes impurity as well as making charges. While selling jewellery, one will not get back making charges, which account for roughly 15-20 per cent of the cost of jewellery, and another 1 per cent goes away as melting loss. Also, the three percent tax paid on jewellery does not get set off at the time of selling jewellery. In other words, one can make a gain on jewellery only when gold prices move up more than 20 per cent. <em>That\u2019s a big hurdle rate.</em> So invest in Gold, not gold jewellery. The smartest buy Gold ETFs.  Ride the rally and have Happy Diwali and a glittering New Samvat Year.  <em>The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official VIEW or position of Credent Asset Management Services Pvt Ltd.</em> <strong>Sunil Damania</strong> Market Expert &nbsp; <strong>CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate", "slug": "not-buying-gold-on-dhanteras", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1N.jpg"}, {"title": "How to make your dividend work smarter", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/how-to-make-your-dividend-work-smarter/", "content": "Many investors buy stocks for higher dividend yield. This strategy may not always be value-accretive as the price of the scrip may fall post dividend. Therefore, what one may have gained through dividend may get lost in the negative price movement, thereby resulting in net loss. Hence, investing in stocks based on dividend yield may not be the right strategy.  Janus, a leading global fund manager, estimates global dividend payout in 2018 would be in the region of $1.36 trillion. With this kind of money, one can buy 100 per cent equity of Apple plus 50 per cent of Microsoft. In India, in the last 12 months, India Inc. paid divided worth Rs 2.06 lac crore. This means that the absolute amount of dividend paid is not small.  India is not among the higher dividend yield markets in the world. As per the data available on www.siblisresearch.com, countries like Australia offer dividend yield as high as 4.03 per cent as on June 2018. UK offers 3.64 per cent, US 1.84 per cent, Japan 1.61 per cent and India 1.22 per cent.  In that sense, India is more of a capital appreciation story. Having said that, there is a strategy investor can adopt to derive the maximum out of dividend.  Unfortunately, when it comes to dividend, investors have no strategy in place. They either use the dividend income on household expenses or keep it in savings bank account which does not earn more than four percent interest. A good strategy would be to use the dividend income to create capital gains. I have explained this below through an example.  When a company you have invested in declares a dividend, you should use that dividend income to buy more shares of the same company. Assume that you had invested in Hero MotoCorp in August 2006. At that time, the stock price was Rs 682. In the next 12 years, you utilised the dividend amount to buy shares of Hero Motocorp. By doing this, you would be now having 146 shares (assuming that you had initially bought 100 shares). Also, every time the company declared dividend, you received dividend not only on your initial 100 shares, but also on shares purchased through dividend. This will ensure that every year your dividend income keeps rising, and through this process, your stake in the company too rises. As the share price keeps moving up, your capital gains also expand. Hero Motocorp share price went up from Rs 682 to Rs 3540. That means the shares bought with dividend amount are also giving you capital appreciation. The CAGR returns from dividend reinvested stands at 11.58 per cent, while the appreciation in the share price during the same period gave you 9.58 per cent CAGR returns. The extra 200 basis point return is accounted for by the reinvested dividend. So, instead of the dividend income earning just 4 per cent in savings bank account, it is now fetching a return of 11.58 per cent. This is a huge gain.  But there is a catch to this strategy. You should reinvest dividend only if you are confident about the company\u2019s growth prospects. If not, you should sell your existing shares too irrespective of what dividend yield its offering. Investment strategy should never be a function of only dividend yield. It should mainly be a function of capital appreciation, with dividend income as an additional tadka to spice up your investment.  Time and again it has been seen, especially among PSU stocks where dividend yields are very high, the stocks turn out to be poor wealth creators. On the other hand, look at some of the best wealth creating stocks in the last one decade. Asian Paints, Britannia, Eicher Motors, among others, created wealth, but they may not feature high on the dividend yield chart.  It is normally believed that the company that pays higher dividend does not need the surplus cash. It also means that these companies have higher visibility of earnings. On the other hand, the company that pays lesser dividend means that the company is preserving its capital for future growth. A country like India, where corporate governance standards are still evolving, a company that pays dividend is considered better than a company that does not pay dividend. This is because dividend is a real cash outflow that gives an indication that the company\u2019s profits are genuine. This logic holds true more in the case of mid-caps and small-caps.  The most common sight in the AGM is investors asking for higher dividend. This is fine if the company does not need growth capital and/or has no borrowings. Some management, in order to keep investors happy, declare higher dividend despite carrying higher borrowings. Result: the company\u2019s stock under performs as the market pays higher premium to companies having nil or low borrowings.  Therefore, instead of asking for a higher dividend, investors should insist with the management that the company should repay debt as this will improve the financial health of the company. Many a time, investors correlate higher dividend with better management quality. This is not necessarily true. World famous investor Warren Buffett does not believe in paying dividend and yet his company has higher investors\u2019 fancy. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway in its corporate history has paid dividend only once. Yes, you read it right. That was way back in 1967. But Buffett does believe in buying back the company\u2019s shares as and when the share price of the company falls below the intrinsic value in order to utilize the idle cash sitting on the balance sheet.  The strategy suggested above can improve alpha in your portfolio. I would strongly recommend this strategy to every investor whether retail or HNIs.

Every rise in the market is proving to be a temporary one. Market moves up 3-4 days in a row, giving some hope that the worst is behind us. But some events, whether global or local, intervene and pull down the indices.  Right now, the market sentiment is the casualty. Investors are confused about how to navigate this market, despite the YTD Sensex being in the green zone. The wealth destruction is reflected from the fact that out of the BSE 500 companies, as many as 394 companies are quoting below their 2017 levels. Even though Sensex is at 35500, my guess is that the sentiment belongs to the 28000 level. There is a pervasive feeling of gloom and doom.  So what should one do in a situation like this? My advice would be: don\u2019t panic. Don\u2019t sell quality stocks that have the potential to generate wealth for you. This phase in the market in transient. I have explained why it is transient a little later.  In these times, I would recommend a few things for you: 1.\tIf a look at your portfolio depresses you, avoid looking at your portfolio on a daily basis. Staring at your portfolio is not going to increase its value, but it may increase your BP!  2.\tNever lose confidence in the equity market. If you are a long term investor, then your attitude should be like that of a long term investor. Long term investors are not bothered by short term market movements. Long term investment is like a five-day cricket match, where few maiden overs do not matter, unlike in a T20 match.  3.\tDon\u2019t buy companies that have fallen due to some stink on corporate governance. These companies are unlikely to rise even if the market improves tomorrow. These would be laggards. Frankly we also never know how many more issues are lurking beneath the surface in these companies. Don\u2019t try to catch falling knives.  4.\tTime to review your portfolio and identify companies whose valuations you believe are quoting above their fundamentals. May be it is time to book losses and use the proceeds to buy good quality companies. This will improve your returns from the portfolio. Look at our mojo stocks. They will guide you for picking good quality companies at reasonable valuations.  5.\tThis is a good time to buy equity. After all, the basic principle of equity is to buy low and sell high. But invariably we end up doing the opposite. Buy in a staggering manner as this market is not going to move up in a hurry.  Why this phase is transient?  Every few years we have seen sharp downward movement. But the beauty about the Indian market is that it bounces back smartly with a new all-time high. Another comforting factor this time is that the Sensex did not move up substantially in a very short time, which was the case in 1992, 2000 or 2008. This time around, the gain in Sensex has been moderate. Also, the rise was not quick. That means the fall would not be as steep as we saw in 1992 or 2000 or 2008. Hence, I don\u2019t expect a major fall in the Sensex from this level.  But I do agree that the valuation of the Indian stock market is above the historical level, but the key is that India Inc must improve its earnings growth cycle. While the rise in crude oil prices along with other input costs did impact margins, the situation now suggests that crude may not run up much from this level. The latest OPEC meeting could not reach a consensus on the production cut, which augurs well for the country. If the world economy slows down, there is little reason for crude oil to move up. The benefit of lower crude oil prices is reflecting on the value of rupee, which has shown some strength in the last few weeks. On the domestic front, the state election results continue to make market nervous, but election results normally have an impact for a day and hence don\u2019t give too much importance to them. The latest RBI policy did give some indication that a cut in the interest rate is not off the table. So, some of the factors that were bothering the market have now started looking less worrisome. Even the FPIs who have been aggressive sellers in the market in September and October have turned positive in November. But to be frank, I don\u2019t see the market running up too much and too fast. We may have pain points for at least next 3-4 months. We should ride out this bad phase. Time to act with a smart strategy, rather than panicking. Darr ke aage jeet hai!

If the declines are due to volatile markets and you are convinced about the stock it is ok. But in good times, like it was for a few years now, we end up collecting a lot of stocks based on tips or \u201cheard on the street\u201d rumours. We have another problem.  As human-beings we have a deep-seated bias\u2026 we like to hold on to our losing stocks in the hope that they come back and readily sell those that are \u201cin-profit\u201d since we think that we can lock in those gains. As a result, we sometimes sell our best and highest potential bets, and keep holding onto companies that are performing poorly.  And here\u2019s the double whammy That comes by holding onto underperforming companies. - when a stock you owned at 100 rupees falls by 30% (to Rs. 70) - for you to recover it has to rise by almost 50%- and you now need to realistically assess whether it is likely to rise by 50%. A low stock price can never help an underperforming company and equally a performing company can never be held down when the markets resume their activity.  In the long term - you should be only bothered about the company - the stock price will follow.  To forget about the stock price and focus on the company and its performance and shift to the winners.

Some of the factors like trade war and slowdown in the global economy are new worries that the market is struggling to grapple with.  For the Indian market, a lot happened in 2018. It was an eventful year \u2013 the Sensex touched all-time high at a kissing distance of the 40,000 landmark (highest value was 38,989). The political fights, NCLT cases, meltdown in mid-caps and small caps, IL&amp;FS crisis, strong SIP flows and heavy selling by the FPIs in the emerging markets, including India, were major highlights. Also, surges in crude prices and the consequent falls in rupee against the dollar are the other highlights of 2018.  As I write this piece, Sensex is up by five per cent in 2018, but sentiment-wise, we are much lower than what we were at the beginning of the year. Only a few stocks are helping the Sensex to remain in the green zone. Out of the BSE 500, as many as 373 stocks are quoting below their levels at the beginning of the year. The market cap of India Inc., which was at Rs 151.73 lac crore at the beginning of the year, is now at Rs 143.30 lac crore. But this number does not reflect the erosion in the quantum of wealth of the retail investors.  After outperforming many years in a row, the mid-cap and small-cap stocks have cracked. Just look at the aggregate market cap of \u201cB\u201d group, which consists of mid-caps and small-caps. It was Rs 24.27 lac crore at the beginning of the year, but presently it is down by almost 50 per cent to Rs 12.21 lac crore! What made matters worse was that some of the favourites of investors such as P C Jewellers (down by 82 per cent), Manpasand Beverages (80 per cent), Vakrangee (91 per cent), DHFL (59 per cent), Jet Airways (70 per cent), Shankara Build (70 per cent) Infibeam (66 per cent), Rain Industries (64 per cent) to name a few, have cracked substantially in 2018. The prices of these companies corrected so sharply that investors could not book profits.  Rocky year, but not as bad as 2008 2018 started on a very strong note with January showing gains of 2000 points. But then came the budget, wherein the government announced reintroduction of long-term capital gains on equity. Since then, the sentiments have turned negative. The SEBI guidelines on realignment of mutual fund schemes also played its part as the AMCs were forced to reshuffle their portfolios. April and July were the best months of 2018 when the Sensex reported gains of more than 2,000 points each. But these gains were either preceded by a fall like in the month of February and March, or got wiped out in subsequent months like in September and October. September was the worst month of 2018, with the Sensex losing 2418 points.  Combined with October, the Sensex lost 4200 points in just two months\u2014creating a fear-like situation similar to the 2008 sub-prime crisis. Investors\u2019 portfolios are yet to recover from the cracks of September and October. 2018 was not an easy year for the mutual fund industry either as the schemes too struggled to report positive gains in NAVs. As per the data available on Morningstar website, barring the three categories (Index, FMCG and IT), almost all categories\u2019 average returns are in the negative. Retail investors this time have shown great maturity by investing in mutual funds through the SIP route. Normally, they panic when the market falls. Hope they continue to have faith in equity in 2019 too.  So, what are the learnings?  <ol> <li>The first big learning is that never chase stocks that are high in demand. If you do that, the probability is very high that you will end up buying companies at the top of the cycles. Some of the above mentioned companies which cracked significantly fit the bill.</li> <li>The second learning is, never try to catch falling knives. Fallen angels take a very long time to regain investors\u2019 confidence, and many times, they never do\u2014like Suzlon. We have seen how companies that have fallen as much as 70 per cent are not able to find buyers even at the lower levels. Is it not strange that what was looking attractive at higher valuations are not attractive at lower levels? Their slide continues.</li> <li>Another learning is that every industry has its cycle. One should not assume that the upward cycle will continue forever. NBFC is a case in point. NBFC industry had a good run in the last few years and many NBFCs created good wealth for the investors. But after the IL&amp;FS crisis in 2018, that cycle got broken. Some of the NBFCs like Aditya Birla Capital is down by 48 per cent. So is the case with Edelweiss, which is down by 38 per cent, DHFL is down by 59 per cent and Ujjivan by 30 per cent. Going by the past trend, when a sector loses its fancy, it takes longer time to regain investors\u2019 confidence. We have seen that with infra\u2014the darling of investors in 2007, or pharma, which was investors\u2019 darling till a couple of years back, but it is struggling now. In 2018, the pharma index is down by 10 per cent, despite many experts believing that 2018 would be a comeback year for pharma. I don\u2019t expect NBFC to regain fancy in a hurry. Hence, don\u2019t go overboard on the sector. Also, keep a close watch on your sectoral allocations. I would suggest a stock-specific approach within the sector.</li> <li>Yet another learning is that the stock market does not like any political party. Despite BJP losing the assembly elections in three key states, the immediate market reaction was upward, as against the general belief that it would go down. The election results do impact the market, but not for more than a day. This learning is important as India will have general elections in the next few months. Don\u2019t take a trade based on which party will come to the power, but take position based on fundamentals of the company. This is the best recipe to make money. Election results are noise and smart investors should avoid noise. One weird coincidence is that whenever the year ends with the digit 8, it turns out to be a bad year for the investors. 2008 was bad for the equity market. I am not sure about how world indices behaved in 1998, but it was a bad year for the Indian equity market. Sensex was down by as much as 16.50 per cent that year. If the same trend continues, 2028 would be a tough year for the equity investors.</li> <li>Lastly, a big learning is that the market loves rotation of sectors. IT was not the favourite of market in 2017 even though the overall market was bullish. But in 2018, the IT sector was a rocking star (BSE IT is up by 24 per cent and TCS is up by 42 per cent) in a subdued market. If you wish to make money in 2019, identify the sector that is down today, but has potential to be outperformer in 2019. That\u2019s the key to make money in the stock market.</li> </ol> Bye Bye 2018. Welcome 2019.  &nbsp; <strong>Sunil Damania</strong> Market Expert <strong>CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate &nbsp; The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official VIEW or position of Credent Asset Management Services Pvt Ltd.", "slug": "the-5-lessons-i-learnt-from-the-markets-in-2018", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/26D.jpg"}, {"title": "Why is the stock market celebrating farm loan waivers?", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/why-is-the-stock-market-celebrating-farm-loan-waivers/", "content": "Farm loan waiver is currently the hot topic and it would gain more currency with the general election around the corner. From politicians to economists to rating agencies, everyone is talking about it. On the first day of assuming office, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath announced farm loan waiver. Similar announcement was made by Chhattisgarh CM too.  The stock market seems to be loving it. In the last one week since the election results were announced, the market has moved up by more than 1,000 points. What makes this rally special is that it is quite broad-based. Each and every sector and even mid-caps and small-caps have participated in the current rally. If we take weekly returns, none of the Sensex-based companies is in the red. The advance-decline ratio is hugely in favour of advances.  So how does one explain this rally? Post-poll surveys showed that the BJP will not do well. That information did not go down well with the market and the market tanked 700 points on Monday, 10th December. The RBI governor Urjit Patel\u2019s resignation gave one more blow to the market to cope with. But the market proved the pundits wrong. Shankar Sharma, the renowned investor, recently tweeted \u2013 \u201cIndia\u2019s amazing post-election results rally has now re-ignited hopes of a bull market. What a remarkable turnaround from the gloom till the preceding week! Just waiting for small-cap confirmation now. If the Feb 2014 rally was termed \u2018Modi rally\u2019, what should this be called?  Should we call it \u201cFarm loan waiver rally\u201d? It would be rather premature to say at the moment whether or not we are entering a new bull market. But one thing is confirmed that the stock market does not have preference for any political party. Whether it is the BJP or the Congress, the market will move as per the fundamentals of India Inc. Investors must keep this fact in mind as general election is just four months down the road.  But what worries me is that there is no change on the fundamental side in the last one week that warrants this rally. On the contrary, something that market should be worried about is the farm loan waiver \u2013 which is again becoming the buzzword to gain rural vote bank. The Congress announced farm loan waiver during Karnataka assembly election and managed to keep the BJP at bay from forming the government, despite the anti-incumbency factor. It announced such waivers in Rajasthan, MP and Chhattisgarh and successfully managed to form the governments in these states. Looking at the success of Congress, many more political parties, including the BJP, will be lured to announce farm loan waivers as part of their election manifestoes to grab their chunk of the rural vote bank. This competition among the political parties will make the economy weak. There are no free lunches. To meet the funds for farm loan waivers, each state government will have to either increase revenue by imposing additional taxes or sacrifice on the capital expenditure to contain deficits. During the election year, increasing tax rates does not pay political dividend. So, expect capital expenditure to be the casualty. This will have huge implications on the growth of the state and, in turn, the country. India\u2019s fiscal position is anyway not in great shape due to the less than expected GST collections and the rising subsidy bill. It is likely that we will slip on deficit numbers or manage by postponing some subsidy amount to the next year. Even ratings upgrade now looks remote. The global environment is not conducive either. IMF has recently indicated that it is likely to cut the world GDP forecast further. In October, IMF reduced world GDP forecast for 2019 from 3.9 per cent to 3.7 per cent. In such a globally challenging environment, farm loan waivers will put additional pressure on the Indian economy. With likely El Nino in 2019 there would be more pressure on the Agri outputs. This year Rabi crop sowing is down by 8 per cent YOY and Kharif production is no better than last year.  Political parties, despite knowing fully well that farm loan waivers are not long-term solutions, time and again resort to the same populist gimmicks to seek narrow partisan ends, keeping aside the country\u2019s interest. Why can\u2019t the Election Commission ban these kinds of announcements? Is it not a bribe to the voters? Why can\u2019t elections be fought and won on the development agenda? How long do we need to live with the \u201cdeveloping economy\u201d tag?  If any political party wants to announce farm loan waivers, let it do so, but the same should be met through the party funds and not from the government\u2019s tax revenues. One does not pay taxes for farm loan waivers.  The stock market will soon realise that farm loan waivers can\u2019t take the country into the league of the developed nations. This rally may not sustain as there are no positive triggers that are lifting the market. Even FPIs, post the election results, are net sellers in the Indian market. Indian mutual funds did not invest heavily either. There have been net outflows from institutional investors. The market needs quality earnings and liquidity to sustain the rally. I don\u2019t see major improvement on either front in the short term. So, don\u2019t get fooled by this rally. This is nothing but \u201ctrap again investor\u201d rally.  PS: Investors can recollect that I wrote a column on 7th December \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"http://r.marketsmojo.info/mk/cl/O_a7a58tUnYd08ZKj7jsoQw9dF1T1xGl6fAPOiZLf6H_aAh7_gO2x8Z61v1uSdwjLqQ1OOjx8uHkIP62t8S6Xrct0UtQCsTbPWVNSTqWNkGSQA\">A Mountain Dew Moment for investors \u2013 Darr Ke Aage Jeet?</a>\u201d suggesting not to panic when market was declining every day. I continue to believe that Indian stock market will do well but next couple of months would be challenging. Not so good quality companies are also moving up in this rally makes me worry.  &nbsp; <strong>Sunil Damania</strong> Market Expert &nbsp; <strong>CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate &nbsp; The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official VIEW or position of Credent Asset Management Services Pvt Ltd", "slug": "why-is-the-stock-market-celebrating-farm-loan-waivers", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/20D.jpg"}, {"title": "Resignations, Rejections, Ram Mandir and Modi \u2013 is this is the beginning of the end?", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/resignations-rejections-ram-mandir-and-modi-is-this-is-the-beginning-of-the-end/", "content": "Surprise!

Who would have thought that just a day before the assembly election results, the RBI governor Urjit Patel would resign with immediate effect?  The big surprise \u2013 the stock market \u2013 which was supposed to move down sharply, ended up closing in the green! This again proves that predicting the stock market movement is not easy. One is not sure about the longevity of today\u2019s stock market positive close, but one thing has been proved that the market is indifferent to which party forms the next government in the three crucial states.  These election results would soon be history as will be Patel\u2019s resignation. Market from Thursday will go back to dancing on various global as well as domestic tunes.  Is this the beginning of the end of the Modi government? Will the Congress, even though it is basking in victory, become confident of winning the general election in 2019?  The Congress got the advantage of anti-incumbency factor in two states where the BJP governments were in the saddle for three terms, and in Rajasthan for one term. A victory by a huge margin in MP and Rajasthan was cause for cheer but, it is not a landslide victory. Congress has a long way to go to win more than 200 seats in the Lok Sabha. The party is weak in many areas. One big problem with the Congress is that it is resorting to populist measures as part of its manifesto. But this kind of strategy cannot take you too far. Rahul Gandhi has moved beyond his \u2018Pappu\u2019 image, but he still lacks the charisma of Modi. His speech goof-ups like the \u2018Kumbhkaran Yojana\u2019 do not inspire confidence, at least among the young voters. Not sure people are ready to believe he is PM material.  The Congress should use this win as a springboard, but one is not sure how much they can build up on these assembly election results. In the past, they have goofed-up, like in Goa. They acted swiftly in Karnataka and announced support to the JD (S) to ensure that the BJP does not form the government. They need to act smartly with the other opposition parties for the general election to ensure that they can take on Modi in a united manner. Rahul Gandhi has proven that Modi is beatable. But instead of going overboard with these wins, he must remember the famous phrase- One swallow does not a summer make.  For Modi, things are difficult. The RSS ultimatum to the him to bring legislation on the Ram temple at Ayodhaya gives an indication of the pressure of the Sangh Parivar on the Modi government. Without the help of RSS, Modi will find it extremely difficult to win the general election. The resignation of Urjit Patel is another episode that has put the Modi government on the back foot. The BJP allies will act tough with the BJP, with one already quitting the NDA.  Close circles in the BJP suggest that the BJP may have to sacrifice Modi as Prime Minister if it fails to get a clear majority in the next general election. BJP may need the support of the other parties to form the government, but they may not be amenable to give support to Modi. In that case, the consensus candidate could be Nitin Gadkari. But this is too early to deliberate on.  In politics, as I said earlier, a few months is too a long period. The wind flow can change very fast. Historically, the state election results are no indication of what is in store in the general election. Nothing can be said with certainty, for now.  It would be foolish to write off Modi. He is a shrewd politician. He has the knack of surprising opposition with his strategies. Remember, he had survived anti-incumbency when he was CM in Gujarat. I have a strong feeling that Modi will formulate a strong plan to counter the might of a united opposition. This defeat will be a good wake up call for both Modi and the BJP. They can strike back with a vengeance to avenge the assembly election defeats. Hence, expect more action on the political front from hereon.  As far as the stock market is concerned, more nervousness is in store, notwithstanding today\u2019s positive close. With little positive domestic news on the horizon and the global winds not favorable, it cannot sustain a rally. Expect market to remain choppy with a negative bias.  On a lighter note, the market has one event less to worry about\u2014the outcome of assembly elections!  &nbsp; <strong>Sunil Damania</strong> Market Expert <strong>CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate &nbsp; The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official VIEW or position of Credent Asset Management Services Pvt Ltd.", "slug": "resignations-rejections-ram-mandir-and-modi-is-this-is-the-beginning-of-the-end", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/11d.jpg"}, {"title": "Betting on the Economy? Think again.", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/betting-on-the-economy-think-again/", "content": "Is the world\u2019s fastest growing economy slowing down?  This is a question bothering many experts, especially after the recent IIP numbers showed a mere 0.5 percent growth for November as against the 8.4 percent growth in October. While one justification for the numbers is that this year Diwali was in November (hence production was done in the previous months to make it available during Diwali time), while it was in October last year. However, even after accounting for this seasonality factor, there are indications that the economy is slowing down.  Let us look at the auto numbers, which clearly shows that the demand has been soft. Car sales for December were at 2.36 lacs as against November sales of 2.63 lacs. Maruti Suzuki \u2013 the largest car maker \u2013 has announced that it would see a mere single digit growth in FY2019. In the last few years, Maruti was growing in double digits. Even the commercial vehicle sales were down in December. Bikes and scooters\u2014that do not warrant higher budget \u2013 have also seen demand going soft.  Even the sales of consumer durables are not showing much robustness. The growth in the aviation passenger traffic hit a 4-year low in November. Even real estate sector, despite the low prices and heavy discounts, is finding it tough to find buyers.  The rural income is also not growing and there are reports that farmers are in distress. That means the rural demand that was going strong not so long ago has also turned weak. With lower sowing during the rabi crop season, the situation is unlikely to improve soon. FMCG companies\u2019 commentary on December quarterly results will throw some light on the ground realities in rural consumption.  The Indian economy grew at a brisk pace of 8.2 per cent in Q1 of FY2019 and dropped to 7.1 per cent in Q2. The next two quarters may see decline in the GDP. Reports suggest that the Indian economy may grow at 7 per cent in the current financial year. This despite the World Bank\u2019s recent report suggesting that the Indian economy would grow at a faster pace of 7.5 per cent in 2019 as against the prediction of 7.3 per cent for 2018. It looks like the World Bank may need to revise its target downward.  Due to the decelerating growth and lower inflation rate, the demand is back again that the RBI should cut interest rate in its next policy meeting on 7th February. It looks like the RBI may oblige this time as low inflation and slower growth does warrant action from the central bank, even considering the global implications. US Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had indicated that the rate hike is not a certainty. He recently said that they are \u201cpatient and watching and waiting and seeing\u201d. Fed has given an indication that it would do two rate hikes in 2019. But it is likely that we may see less than two rate hikes. This should make the RBI comfortable in terms of easing the rates.  The RBI understands that the global economy is slowing down, and hence, it may not be easy for India to grow at a faster clip with higher interest rate. The rupee has stabilized against the dollar.  Another problem is that this is an election year. So, new projects and plans will take a back seat. Even private sector players have put projects on hold as they would like to see the composition of the new government and its agenda for the future. In the next 40 days, the election schedule would be announced. The government machinery would be in a slow mode till the new government takes over the reins. That could impact the economic activity. While one may argue that the election spending may spur more consumption, this may not reflect in the March quarter numbers. Even during the last general election, the March 2014 GDP number remained depressed.  India Inc has been always expecting growth in earnings that could justify higher valuations. We have seen disappointment on this front in the last few years. It looks like the numbers for the next two quarters (December and March) may disappoint too due to slowdown in the domestic as well as world economy. I see remote possibility of earnings lifting the market sentiments, at least till July.  Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will present the budget on 1st February, but one should not expect any major announcements, except for some populist measures. In the last few months, the Modi government has gone in active mode to win the electorate with measures like quota for higher castes, GST relief, and so on. This has created fear of slipping on fiscal deficit. In that sense, there is nothing much to cheer about on the macroeconomic front. Market will take note of this.  <strong>Sunil Damania </strong>Market Expert <strong>CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official VIEW or position of Credent Asset Management Services Pvt Ltd.", "slug": "betting-on-the-economy-think-again", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/16th-jan.jpg"}, {"title": "Play the stock market like Cheteshwar Pujara", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/play-the-stock-market-like-cheteshwar-pujara/", "content": "India scored its first Test series victory in Australia. The credit for this victory to a great extent goes to Cheteshwar Pujara who played like a true champion.  Why am I talking about cricket when this forum is for investments? There is learning in the victory that I wish to draw attention to.  Who was more consistent batsman between Australia\u2019s McGrath and India\u2019s Sachin Tendulkar? Many of you would answer Sachin Tendulkar. This looks obvious, but it is not true. Between the two, the consistent batsman was McGrath. Tendulkar in an inning could score anywhere between zero to 200-plus, but one could not be too sure about how much Tendulkar would score in the next inning. On the other hand, McGrath, as we all know, would score anything between zero to 10 (his test career batting average is 7.4). We also know that it was easier to predict McGrath\u2019s score in the next inning than predicting Tendulkar\u2019s.  You should look at the difference between debt and equity investing in a similar way. The returns on debt are more predictable than equity. One knows what returns one would make at the end of the year and also the date on which the principal amount would be returned.  On the other hand, equity is unpredictable. No one knows for sure what kind of returns the equity portfolio would generate at the end of the year. Also, one is not sure whether the capital would come back or go down the drain.  Having said this, people make mistakes when it comes to taking sound investment decisions.  If you were asked to pick a batsman for a team between McGrath and Tendulkar, who would you choose? The obvious and sensible answer would be Tendulkar. That means, despite Tendulkar\u2019s next inning score being less predictable, you know that over the longer period, Tendulkar would score more runs with higher average than McGrath. That makes me wonder why people prefer debt (McGrath)? They forgo higher returns to get consistency of returns.  Over the years, there are plenty of empirical evidences that prove that equity offers higher returns than debt instruments.  The only problem with equity is that its returns are lumpy.  What holds true for the equity market also holds true for stocks. Many investors do get frustrated when the scrip they bought refuses to go up. They are quick to move out of the stock, thinking that they had made a wrong selection. They chase stocks that are flavor of the season. In cricketing parlance, it\u2019s like chasing the ball outside the off stump. This kind of strategy more often than not proves detrimental to the health of the portfolio.  Investment takes its own time to play out. It may not happen in one year. Many a time, it takes many years together. Let me share with you my own experience. I had bought Bombay Burmah in February 2006 at Rs 72. After I bought the shares, the company\u2019s share price started moving down, and after that fall, it moved sideways for the next 5-6 years. But I did not panic as I knew that the scrip had the potential to generate returns. I always follow two rules while investing. I look at the relationship between the cost and value, and risk and returns. I knew that the cost I had paid for the stock was much lower than the value I was getting. I also knew that the risk I was taking was much lower than the returns it can generate. Investors normally overestimate the value and underestimate the risk. Today, Bombay Burmah is quoting at Rs 1,300, creating manifold returns for me (my average cost of shares is Rs 48 as the company declared bonus in the ratio of 1:2 in 2012).  I continue to hold the scrip.  Late Parag Parikh, the famous investor, once said at a Morningstar conference about the \u201claw of farm\u201d. He explained his theory of the law of farm at the event, saying \u201cYou cannot sow something today and reap tomorrow. A seed has to go through different seasons before it turns into a fully grown tree and starts bearing fruit. Value investing is boring.\u201d Yes, investment is boring, just like the way Cheteshwar Pujara plays test cricket. But that boring technique yields plenty of runs. Equity investment is like a five-day cricket match. If you approach it like T20, you are bound to lose the match (investments).  I even admire Rohit Sharma\u2019s batting style. He is one of the most smashing batsmen in the shorter version of the game. But he also understands that one must spend time on the pitch. One would have observed that Sharma\u2019s first 50 runs take much longer time, but the next 50 runs come in almost half the number of balls taken for the first 50.  Equity is something similar. The first 20 per cent returns may frustrate you, but once the scrip starts moving up, it can go up many times in the next couple of years. The only catch here is that one should have done fair assessment of the parameters, namely, cost vs value and risk vs returns.  I would recommend playing like Pujara to make money on the stock market. Investment is a five-day match. Accept the fact that few overs would be maiden (means few months may not generate returns), but the returns will come when you dig your heels and play well.  &nbsp; <strong>Sunil Damania </strong>Market Expert <strong>CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official VIEW or position of Credent Asset Management Services Pvt Ltd.", "slug": "play-the-stock-market-like-cheteshwar-pujara", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/8th-jan.jpg"}, {"title": "Will Real Estate stocks ever recover or will they go the way of Real Estate itself?", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/will-real-estate-stocks-ever-recover-or-will-they-go-the-way-of-real-estate-itself/", "content": "<strong>Should one Buy real estate or shares of real estate companies? Which is better option?</strong> Sometime last year, a message was circulating on social media suggesting that had someone bought shares of Eicher in 2007 instead of buying Royal Enfield bike (manufactured by Eicher) with the same amount, one would have made enough money to buy a BMW car 10 years later. On a similar line, I can recollect my conversation with my friend about 20 years back. I was having coffee at the Sea Lounge at The Taj Hotel \u2013 Gateway of India. I offered my friend, who was passing by, a cup of coffee. He smiled and jokingly said, \u2018Instead of buying me coffee, please give me one share of Indian Hotels-the company that owns the Taj Hotel\u2019. At that time, the price of coffee and the price of Indian Hotels share were almost the same. I am not sure that he would have been better off now as Indian Hotels share price did not move up as much as was expected in the last 20 years or so.  Very recently, I read an interview of Marc Faber in one of the leading business newspapers where Marc Faber had opined that Indian real estate sector will do well. Let me reproduce what he said, \u201cI would focus on investments in real estate because India is in the early stages of economic development and not in every sector, but in many sectors, it is in the early stages of building a very large middle class and then it becomes attractive to own a home. The first residence, whether that is nearby Delhi or in Delhi or Mumbai or wherever. And then the second thing is that these aspiring millennials and young people who have money want a second home, they want maybe a condo on the beach or they want a house for weekends, so forth. So, I think that real estate in India is still in the infant stage of economic development if you compare it to other countries\u201d.  A thought came to my mind. Should one apply the same logic of Eicher and instead of buying real estate, invest the same amount of money to buy shares of listed real estate companies? Would this strategy be as successful as Eicher or would it go kaput like Indian Hotels? Will postponement of buying 2BHK flat in one of the distant suburbs of Mumbai now and using that money to buy shares of real estate companies help buy a penthouse after 10 years in one of the posh localities in Mumbai?  To be sure, Marc Faber\u2019s logic was valid even 10 years back as India was growing with more and more people moving to cities for better prospects. The rising urbanisation, coupled with better standard of living, pushed up the demand for real estate. In the last 10 years or so, many real estate companies went public and offered many opportunities to put this strategy of buying shares of real estate companies instead of real estate into practice.  I started doing research on this and the result was surprising. Let me start with DLF \u2013 India\u2019s most valuable real estate company. DLF tapped the market in June 2007 and generated enough heat at that time. At one point of time, there was news that it would be India\u2019s most valuable company, even surpassing Reliance Industries. After more than a decade since listing, it is trading at 66 percent discount to its IPO price! Clearly, buying real estate from DLF would have been much better than buying its shares. But one company\u2019s example does not depict a trend. That forced me to look at share price performance of some more companies.  The second most valuable company is Oberoi Realty, which went public in January 2013 at a price of Rs 260. Today, after almost six years, its share price is up by 73.5 per cent\u2014offering CAGR of less than 10 per cent. Despite the real estate prices being subdued presently, I am sure that the price of the flat constructed by Oberoi would have given better returns than the appreciation in its share price.  Most of the real estate companies, as one can see in the table below, failed to live up to the shareholders\u2019 expectations. Some of the old listed real estate companies have performed the worst, including D S Kulkarni, which stands suspended, and Ansal Housing, which has under-performed big time.  <img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1261\"src=\"https://credentasset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/111.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"791\"height=\"268\"/> I would say that the listed real estate companies created huge amount of wealth destruction for the investors, because even while the stock market went up, the share prices of these companies went down. They did not give any meaningful returns to the investors over the long term. Many of them are not investor-friendly too as they have rarely declared dividend or bonus. Also, time and again, the issue of corporate governance keeps cropping up.  Only one company that stood out among the lot is Godrej Properties, which is up by 173 percent since its IPO in December 2009. But that\u2019s an exception. Indiabulls Real Estate offered some hope, but in the last 12 months, its share price is down by 60 per cent.  Based on this, I have come to the conclusion that between the two choices, one should buy real estate instead of buying shares of real estate companies. I would also recommend buying ready-to-move-in real estate.  Having said that, I am not sure whether as an asset class real estate will do well. It has been observed in the past that real estate did not do well in terms of price appreciation when there was non-Congress government at the Centre. If Modi government gets re-elected, the trend of under-performance may get extended further.  There is another change happening that is not good for the long term growth trajectory of the real estate. Today\u2019s generation is not very keen to buy real estate. It is no longer a priority for them. Job-hopping within the country, and sometimes on foreign shores, reduces the need for owning real estate. For them, staying on lease rental is a preferred option. When things like taking furniture on rent is gaining popularity, I doubt that the new generation would like to commit big money for real estate. Technology is another game-changer that would make travelling faster, helping people stay long distances and yet reach office on time. Cheap data and advancement in technology like AI would reduce the need for physical presence in the office. All in all, there are headwinds that may not allow real estate as an asset class to do well.  So, with due respect, I beg to differ with Marc Faber\u2019s assessment. Buy real estate only if you wish to use it for self-use. For investment, there are better options available.  &nbsp; <strong>Sunil Damania </strong>Market Expert <strong>CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official VIEW or position of Credent Asset Management Services Pvt Ltd.", "slug": "will-real-estate-stocks-ever-recover-or-will-they-go-the-way-of-real-estate-itself", "category": "blog", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3rd-jan.jpg"}, {"title": "Interim Budget or Re-Election Manifesto?", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/interim-budget-or-re-election-manifesto/", "content": "<strong>Finance Minister Mr. Piyush Goyal did a good job for his party by not only highlighting what NDA government achieved in the last four-and-half years, but also ensured that its vote banks are kept in good spirits by announcing various sops.</strong> We had a hint that the Government would use this Budget was to make a statement to the middle class, farmers and women. So, whenever FM talked on proposals for these three segments, he spoke in Hindi to ensure that the target audiences understood the announcements.  If you ask me, there is nothing much in the interim Budget that would call for a change in the outlook for the economy or for the stock market. From the stock market point of view, some relief on LTCG was expected, but it did not come through. In fact, it was too much to expect, as the stock market investors are not the constituency the government wants to address in the Election year. When the LTCG tax on equity was introduced last year, the justification was that it is the rich who benefit from the same and, hence, they should be taxed. Any relief in LTCG tax would have meant that the rich have been given concession at the cost of poor.  There are a few highlights I would like to mention. The FM spelt out vision for India by 2030 in ten dimensions like strong physical and social infra, Digital India, green earth and blue sky, expanding rural industrialization, clean rivers, making good use of coastline, putting astronaut in space, food exports, healthy India and last minimum government and maximum governance. While the intent is good, it would be crucial to see how well it\u2019s executed.  This part of the speech sounded like an Election manifesto rather than an interim Budget by an outgoing Government. Politically it was a coup, the Congress has very little left to promise to people and will have to be really creative to win any brownie points before the Election. And whats worse, they can\u2019t even undo the promises made by this Government, even if they win. A real dilemma.  Over the years, the Budget has been losing its importance as most of the reforms on direct as well as indirect taxes are done outside of it. Budget has merely become an incremental announcement of reforms or tax rationalisation. The implementation of the GST has taken away the charm of the Budget as modification of indirect taxes is being done by the GST Council and not by FM. The GST Council meets more than once in a financial year unlike the Budget, which is presented once in a year. In the recent past, we have seen government tinkering with other indirect taxes to meet immediate challenges, like it decreased the duty on petrol and diesel when the crude oil prices were surging and rupee was falling. Similarly, the government also increased duty on imports when it realized that cheap imports are hurting local manufacturers. In that sense, the indirect taxes are no longer the domain of the Budget alone.  As far as the stock market is concerned, the event is over. From Monday onward, the stock market would start looking at various international as well as domestic events, including the general Elections. In the next 30 days, the Election schedule would be announced and then the focus of the market would shift on who would form the next government.  Hence, I would suggest investors not to read too much in this Budget. Real estate companies share prices shot up after the Budget, but I am not sure they are good buys. The announcements are not game changer for the sector till the demand revives. The same way, some of consumption stocks have also moved up on the belief that tax rebates would spur consumption. While I do agree that this would put some money in the hands of the consumers, one should also look at the valuations as many of the consumer-facing companies are commanding rich valuations. Investors do get carried away by the Budget announcements, but that trend does not sustain beyond a day. Just to prove a point, last year out of the top 10 gainers on the Budget day, as many as 7 companies are quoting below the Budget levels in one year.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1277\"src=\"https://credentasset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"554\"height=\"307\"/> Hence don\u2019t take any investment decisions purely based on Budget announcements but look at the fundamentals of the company and the sector. Remember that this is just an interim Budget. The main Budget would be presented in July by the newly elected government.  From Monday onward, fundamentals would dictate the market.

Both these companies have struggled to report growth in their bottom lines. On the other hand, companies like TCS and Hindustan Unilever did well on the bourses as they have no debt and have good amount of liquidity in the balance sheet. Look at the table below that shows best returns in last one year came from zero debt companies in last one year.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1296\"src=\"https://credentasset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/8thFeb_A.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"647\"height=\"337\"/> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1295\"src=\"https://credentasset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/8thFeb_B.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"648\"height=\"335\"/> Only exception to this rule is Reliance Industries, whose debt has increased from Rs 1.94 lac crore to Rs 2.34 lac crore as it did huge capex on the Jio business. Despite this increase in debt, its debt-equity ratio continues to be less than one. Since the company\u2019s commodity business is generating big cash flow, investors are not worried too much about its debt levels. They would start worrying the moment it crosses the ratio of 1.  <strong>What\u2019s wrong?</strong> In the last one year or so, one distinct pattern has emerged. Investors have developed apathy towards companies carrying higher debt. On top of it, if promoters\u2019 shares are pledged, then it becomes a strictly \u2018no go\u2019 area.  While concern on pledged shares was aired in the past, it has gained more importance recently after the Zee episode. Before the Zee incident, pledged shares were not considered as a problem area in good quality companies as investors took comfort in the fact that the company had strong financials and the stock price movement was steady. But the Zee episode has revealed that when investors start selling shares, they don\u2019t look at the financials or the PE the company is commanding. They are in a rush to move out.  New set of investors don\u2019t come in even at the lower price to lap up the shares, suggesting that the valuation premium the company used to command has diminished. The damage is done and it remains. With no circuit limits on the share prices of large companies (as they are in the F&amp;O segment and hence, technically, they can fall as much as 99 per cent in a day), those who lent money against the pledged shares get jittery. They sell shares to protect their interests. As a result, the slide continues.  Zee Group acted swiftly and managed to arrest the slide further as the Group did an agreement with the lender and bought time till September 2019. The verdict is not yet out whether it is a temporary relief or a permanent one. In case the company\u2019s financials in the next two quarters don\u2019t live up to investors\u2019 expectations, the bear cartel can and will exploit the situation.  This episode holds lessons for the investors. The standard debt-equity ratio of 2:1 is pass\u00e9. In today\u2019s changing business environment, things are moving much faster than in the past. Not many companies are able to adjust to the new paradigm. In the process, the company\u2019s financials suffer and then the debt-equity ratio keeps rising, and a stage comes when the company is not able to repay the debt and defaults.  Take the case of Reliance Communications (RCom)\u2014the Anil Ambani Group company\u2014which recently moved the NCLT for its debt resolution. RCom four years back had debt-to-equity ratio of less than 1. But Jio\u2019s entry changed the business model for telecom companies. RCom could not compete. The company\u2019s financials moved from profits to losses. Denominator shrunk and numerator increased. Investors lost money big time. What can happen to RCom can happen to any company.  <strong>What\u2019s the solution?</strong> Simply this \u2013 even if a company has debt-equity ratio of 1:1, investors should study the company\u2019s financials closely. With global uncertainties and the fast-changing pace of technology, many businesses may not be able to service even 1:1 debt-equity ratio. If you wish to play ultra-safe, then buy companies that are debt-free or have a negative debt (means they carry higher liquid investments than debt in their balance sheets). These companies would be in a better position to take on the competition due to their better fighting prowess, and stable balance sheets.  Investors pay higher premium if companies are debt-free or have negative debt. What is looking costly may continue to remain costly as such companies are scarce. Companies with zero debt and no mortgage of promoters\u2019 holdings are tough to find.  Despite the leading stock indices trading close to all-high time levels, the market sentiments continue to remain weak. Every day there are more declines than advances. In this kind of market, I would prefer to park my hard-earned money in companies where profits are increasing with zero debt and promoters have no pledged shares. If these three conditions are met, I would zero in on these companies. If valuation is found reasonable, I would add the company in my portfolio. I would suggest a similar strategy for investors too.  <strong>Sunil Damania </strong>Chief Investment Officer \u2013 Marketsmojo.com &nbsp; <strong>CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate Disclaimer: This blog is only for education purpose.

That is the biggest pain point. I am outlining four factors that I use for my 'sell' decision.</strong></em> Some investor-favourite stocks have fallen more than 50 per cent from their all-time highs. I am sure we now wish that we had sold these stocks at the right time as we are staring at the losses.  Well, most investors, despite spending many years in the stock market, do not master exit strategy. Often they end up selling a stock at the wrong time.  The biggest reason that investors desist from selling a stock is: what if the scrip goes up after I sell out? That is the biggest pain point. It is like buying a mobile with a fear that next day a new model will be available at a lower price.  How do we fix that? First the basics: It is not the buying price alone that decides your quantum of profit or loss on your investment, but also the timing of your exit. Investors don\u2019t exit stocks despite sitting on tonnes of money as they become greedy. The result? They end up holding the stocks for a very long time.  A long holding period does not necessarily result in capital appreciation, but may lead to huge losses. Those who bought GVK, Unitech, Financial Technologies or Suzlon (to name a few) in 2005 and are still holding them will relate to this.  In the investor guru books, we have all been taught that one should buy good quality stocks for long term investments. Agreed. But holding stocks for the long term is no guarantee of return. Those who had bought Suzlon or Reliance Communications in 2007 and are still holding them can vouch for the same. Remember, these companies were either part of the indices or blue chips with wide coverage from analysts and fund managers.  The Mahabharat story is a testimony. While Arjun knew how to enter and exit the Chakravyuh, his son Abhimanyu knew how to enter the Chakravyuh, but had no knowledge of how to break out of it. He lost his life in the battle. Many investors are like Abhimanyu. They get killed on their exit strategy. They know how to enter the stock, but they hardly know when to exit it. The key to be successful in the stock market is to be like Arjun\u2014who knew how to enter and exit.  Most market experts advise what to buy, rarely does one tell you when to sell. Hence, what you have bought based on tips remains with you forever in the portfolio. Human nature is to hold on to loss-making stocks forever. For some unknown reason, investors are quick to act on the profitable stocks, but slow to act on the loss-making ones. They don\u2019t realise that loss-making investment is not going to yield any returns over a long period of time.  How can one be Arjun of the stock market?  Let me give you a few guidelines that I follow whenever I wish to exit a stock. I apply these guidelines not only for profitable investments, but also to loss-making ones.  I am outlining four factors that I use for my \u2018sell\u2019 decision.  <strong>1. Sector fancy</strong> The sector premium decides what PE a company will command. In the 2003-2008 rally, we had seen infra stocks having PE expansion as the sector was the flavour of the season. On similar lines, from 2009 to 2016, the pharma sector was the flavour of the season. Companies such as Sun Pharma saw its PE expanding from 12 times in 2009 to close to 40 times (it went even higher) or Glaxo Pharma whose PE expanded from 21 times to as high as 80 times. With EPS expanding too, it pushed up share price many times. But pharma sector lost its fancy somewhere between fag end of 2016 to beginning of 2017. In the last two years, the pharma index underperformed by a huge margin. Investors are not willing to pay the same PE that the pharma companies once used to command. Many investors are holding these stocks thinking that they would make an exit with a profit. I am not going into the merits or demerits of investing in pharma companies now. The point I wish to highlight is that it is a big fallacy when investors believe that the fancy for the sector would remain forever. They hardly realise that once a sector loses its fancy, it takes a very long time for the sector to make a comeback. Infra stocks were the flavour between 2003 to 2008, but these stocks did not participate when the Sensex touched all-time high. Investors had enough chance in 2008 to move out from infra companies, but they thought this would be a temporary phase. Since they had seen higher prices for the stocks, they were not willing to sell the shares at 20 per cent discount from those higher prices. They held on to the stocks in the belief that the stocks will bounce back. They never did. Many companies are now quoting at 5 per cent of their peak levels. What is more frustrating is that the indices moved up in the interim, creating a double whammy for the investors. I would normally make an exit the moment I realise that the sector is losing its fancy. It is not easy to find out at an early stage whether or not the sector has lost fancy. But once you realise that it has, it is better to move out without delay. One of the ways to find out whether or not a sector has lost fancy is when the stocks from the sector stop touching 52-week highs. On the other hand, companies that move down by at least 20 per cent from their highs without any obvious reason do suggest that the fancy for the sector is on the wane.  <strong>2. Company\u2019s fundamentals start showing fatigue</strong> Every investor loves a company that reports smart growth. That company also commands better premium too from the investors. My antenna goes up when a growing company suddenly stops reporting growth numbers for at least two consecutive quarters. In that case, I would book profits. It is very unlikely that the company will command the same respect from the investors as it used to. So, even if the company\u2019s EPS improves, there is no guarantee that the company will give capital appreciation. Just take the case of Sun Pharma, which came out with excellent quarterly financial numbers on 12<sup>th</sup> Feb. The scrip did not see any re-rating. Sun Pharma has been struggling to report consistent growth in its financials since December 2016. Since then, it has been underperforming.  <strong>3. Corporate governance issue</strong> I have low tolerance level on the issue of corporate governance. The moment there is a cloud over corporate governance in the company, I would exit from the counter. What is crucial to watch is how the management responds to the issue. Despite management\u2019s clarification, if the scrip refuses to rise, it shows that the market is in no mood to give benefit of doubt to the management. Remember DHFL, Financial Technologies, Vakrangee, Manpasand Beverages. These companies came under scrutiny due to corporate governance issues. Their managements clarified, but the scrips did not move up. This despite nothing has been proved against them yet. It is highly unlikely that these companies will see the previous peak levels in a hurry. Some may never touch those levels again.  Normal investor\u2019s tendency is to ignore the corporate governance issue and hope that the share price will bounce back. Some are more adventurous and buy more shares at the declines, thinking it is a good opportunity to buy the same.  Just for clarification, I did not have any of the companies mentioned above in my portfolio.  <strong>4. The Golden Rule</strong> Never look at the share price after you sell the stock. It\u2019s a wasteful exercise. This exercise will make you sad. I never look at the stock price once I move out for at least six months, unless there is substantial news on the company that forces me to relook at the company. At that time, I don\u2019t see whether the scrip is quoting above or below my sell price. I reassess the company at that point of time to take a call on the company.  On many occasions, it might happen that the share price moves up after you exit. Don\u2019t bother. There is a high probability that you would not have sold the shares at the price when it peaked. You would have seen the share price going high, only to see it falling substantially, giving you a big regret.  I would suggest you follow the four points mentioned above rigorously. There is a possibility that this strategy may not always work. In some instances, you may see the scrips moving up substantially after you sell. But that would happen otherwise too. No one can sell shares at the peak price consistently. Don\u2019t fool yourself that you would be able to.  Profit booked is more important than book profit.  <strong>Sunil Damania </strong>Chief Investment Officer \u2013 Marketsmojo.com <strong> CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate Disclaimer: This blog is only for education purpose.

To protect consumers, especially the poor, it would be essential to accompany farm price corrections with an income support scheme for the poor.  Farmers now have subsidized fertilizer, subsidized power, free irrigation water from canals and support prices that promise to go as high as decibel levels of farmer protest can lift them. Yet, farmers are in distress, committing suicide in droves and political parties and governments panicking into promises of loan waivers and income support. But this will not cure farm distress.  <strong>Don\u2019t Repress Farm Prices </strong> Three things are required bring mellow content to India\u2019s fields. One is fast overall growth to shift ever-larger proportions of the rural population into non-farm work and into towns. Another is to let farmers capture a higher share of the value their produce acquires, through cleaning, grading, packaging and processing, before it reaches the consumer. The third is to reconfigure cropping patters to suit agro climatic conditions and benchmark Indian agricultural prices against global ones, not through fiat but by allowing reasonably unrestrained international trade in agricultural produce and letting spot, futures and derivative markets for commodities work.  A tad less than 50% of the workforce is still engaged in agriculture in India, and they produce less than 15% of GDP. The figure is 2% in the US and Britain, perhaps double that in other European nations. The short point is that as economies evolve, fewer and fewer people earn their livelihood from the farm, and farms account for forever smaller shares of the total output.  Industry and services grow much faster than agriculture. Most of organized industry and services take place in an urban environment. This is what leads to urbanization, as economies prosper.  Singur was about setting up a car factory. Since India does not have readymade towns where a large factory can come up from scratch, setting up a factory entails, in most cases, setting up a township as well. Urbanization and industrial growth take place side by side. Similar is the case with service industries. They need huge amounts of office space, to offer which new townships or extensions of existing towns come up.  How can farmers capture a larger share of the value added to their produce? The first step is to shrink the chain that connects them to the consumer, and make transactions along the chain transparent. The cotton farmer in Gujarat gets a good price because the ginner, who takes the seeds out of cotton bolls, functions in front of him and the farmer, gets forward visibility on the price the ginner gets when he sells his seed-free cotton fluff to the yarn maker.  Amul farmers get a decent price because of the cooperative structure that does not try to make a huge profit for itself. The world\u2019s largest milk producer, New Zealand\u2019s Fonterra, is a cooperative. Cooperatives and farmer producer companies can take on the job of mobilizing capital and investing in processing plants and marketing infrastructure, to give farmers a larger share of the value added to their produce. This calls for radical changes in Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee rules and entrepreneurial energy of the kind V Kurien brought to Amul.  &nbsp; <strong>Shield the Poor</strong> The hardest part is changing the crop mix to suit each region\u2019s agro climatic conditions. Arid Maharashtra grows sugarcane because of subsidized power for irrigation, subsidized fertilizers, and subsidized loans. Tamil Nadu fights with Karnataka for water and uses it to grow water-guzzling sugarcane. Eastern UP and Bihar, India\u2019s and probably the world\u2019s best places for growing sugarcane, because of abundant water and the plant\u2019s ability to survive even two weeks  of floods under water, hardly grow any. This is because of missing law and order.  Cane must be crushed immediately after being harvested \u2014 delay depresses sugar recovery. That means the factory must be near the cane fields. But because of the likelihood of the manager\u2019s family being kidnapped for ransom, no manager is forthcoming, and ditto for factories.  If Punjab and Haryana could move large tracts from rice with its flood irrigation and soil salinity to horticulture or floriculture, India will stop having rotting mountains of grain procured at distortionary prices in public stocks. Maharashtra could grow grapes instead of cane. What to grow where would be determined by demand and know-how, in transmitting which a functioning market plays an effective role. Farm economist Ashok Gulati has estimated that by disallowing trade-benchmarked prices for Indian farm produce, farmers have significant negative protection in India, even with nominal subsidies.  Free up farm prices, divert a large part of the subsidies to productivity boosting investment and give some subsidy as cash support and watch Indian farmers capture a rising share of the world\u2019s farm exports. As farm prices go up to end rural distress, poor consumers would need some income support, too.

Reading his letter is always a treat. It is full of pearls of wisdom for the investors. One can learn so much from his wisdom gained over the last 77 years of investing.</strong> <em>There is fear in the markets. The small cap and mid caps continue to bleed like there is no bottom. Elections and our not-so-friendly neighbor add to the uncertainty. Is it the best time to buy?</em> Every year, I wait for Buffett\u2019s letter which he writes to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. Reading his letter is always a treat. It is full of pearls of wisdom for the investors. One can learn so much from his wisdom gained over the last 77 years of investing. Many would be surprised that Buffett started investing at an early age of 11 and today, even at the age of 88 years, he is still actively engaged in the business. This is a sharp contrast to many amongst us who would decide to hang boots at his age. Warren Buffett has no plan to retire. He writes, \u201cCertain shareholders will simply decide it\u2019s time for them or their families to become net consumers rather than continuing to build capital. Charlie and I have no current interest in joining that group\u201d. On a lighter note, he adds, \u201cPerhaps we will become big spenders in our old age.\u201d His partner Charlie Munger\u2019s age is 95. Even at this age, he has desire for elephant-sized acquisition.  <strong>Cautious of value he pays for the company</strong> Over the years, I have realized that Buffett talks about buying the right company at reasonable valuations. This year is no exception either, where he again emphasizes on valuation. Despite his company Berkshire sitting on a huge pile of cash and cash equivalents ($112 billion, to be precise) he writes that he would be buying ably-managed companies, either in whole or in part, that possess favorable and durable economic characteristics, but at <em>sensible prices</em>. He believes that right now the prices are sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term prospects. Let me quote him what he has stated at the fag end of this year\u2019s letter, \u201c\u2026a ridiculously-high purchase price for a given stock will cause a splendid business to become a poor investment \u2013 if not permanently, at least for a painfully long period.\u201d Most of the investors try to chase quality companies at very expensive valuations, resulting in poor long-term returns. Just to give an example-Larsen and Toubro is an excellent company in the infra space, but someone who bought the stock in December 2007 would be making poor long-term returns.  Buffett has equity portfolio of $173 billion invested in some of the listed companies \u2013 his portfolio being much larger than that managed by the Indian equity mutual fund industry. In the last 23 years, Berkshire created CAGR of 20.5 per cent as against S&amp;P 500 returns of 9.7 per cent, which clearly shows how with great discipline one can generate long term returns that are much higher. Discipline comes when one has clarity of thought and confidence in one\u2019s investment style. This is what many investors lack.  <strong>Not a big fan of quarterly results</strong> We do see share price fluctuates widely on announcement of quarterly results. Warren Buffett has time and gain advised investors not to get carried away by the quarterly results. He writes in the letter, \u201cCharlie and I have never focused on current quarter results.\u201d He is also against management giving quarterly forecast. Last year in June, Buffett along with Jamie Dimon of J P Morgan Chase (Berkshire has 1.5 per cent stake in J P Morgan Chase) argued that quarterly forecast encourages unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term growth and financial strength of the company. They also argued then that companies often hesitate to spend on technology, hiring and R&amp;D to meet quarterly earnings forecasts, which can be affected by seasonal factors that are beyond management control.  Some of the good Indian quality companies realized that it is safe to stay away from giving quarterly forecasts. Infosys used to do the same, but abandoned the practice from July 2012 as it realized that quarterly forecast did more damage to its wealth creating story than good. TCS never gave any quarterly forecast.  Buffett writes openly that their target audience is not analysts or commentators, but shareholder partners. He believes that the managements do all sorts of things to meet the quarterly targets. He described as what starts with \u201cinnocent fudge\u201d for not wanting to disappoint \u201cthe street\u201d becomes a step towards full-fledged fraud.  A learning for investors is to avoid companies that give lofty targets to attract the street. There is a high probability that these companies may find it hard to achieve the targets. Therefore, in order not to please the street, they may do things that they would not have done otherwise. But beyond a point, they may not be able to manage the same. The price will then crash. On the other hand, if the management decides not to fudge accounts and if they don\u2019t achieve the target, the market would punish them. In either case, there is no gain. So, a good policy is not to raise expectations unnecessarily high which could lead to a problem at a later stage. In India, we have seen some mid-cap companies facing heavy pressure on their share price as they created hype they could not deliver.  <strong>No equity dilution is a good sign</strong> Berkshire has not seen much dilution of capital in the last 20 years or so. This resulted in good reward for its shareholders. In India too we have seen how companies have rewarded shareholders with good wealth when there was no equity dilution. Two names that come to my mind are MRF and Asian Paints. These companies grew their businesses without diluting equity. The rest is history. On the other hand, companies that do frequent dilution don\u2019t enjoy premium on the bourses.  Berkshire share Class A trades at $3 lac (Rs 2.13 crore). That puts the share out of reach of many investors, not only in the developing countries, but also in the developed countries, including the US. Yet Berkshire did not announce splits or bonus shares. In India, investors get excited with splits and bonuses without realizing that splits and bonuses don\u2019t increase the value of the company, but they are mere book entries. On the other hand, Buffett uses buyback as a strong tool to enhance shareholder value. He has stated that this year he would do significant repurchase of shares at the appropriate time. In India too, many companies announce buyback of equity. Buyback adds value only when it is done at a price lower than its intrinsic worth. I am not sure how much Indian management follows this rule.  <strong>Make hay while the sun sets</strong> You may find something wrong with this heading at the first instance. But this is what Buffett believes in. In 2017 annual letter, he wrote, \u201cMake hay while the sun sets; knowing that it will surely rise again\u201d. The common adage is- Make hay while sun shines! Buffett believes in grabbing opportunity at the right time and, when the situation demands, taking a big meaningful risk. He wrote then, \u201cEvery decade or so, dark clouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it\u2019s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons.\u201d How often investors take big bets on the stocks when they have crashed? If at all one has bought, it may not be in large quantity. He wrote that during scary periods, one should not forget two things. First, widespread fear is your friend as an investor since it helps you to have bargain purchases. Second, he says that you should not become fearful; otherwise it becomes your enemy. Often investors make the second mistake, where they become fearful and therefore do not take big bets.  The reason I got tempted to take this advice from a letter written two years back is that I can relate this to today\u2019s environment. Many of the good quality mid-cap and small-cap stocks have taken a huge beating. Their valuations have become very attractive and yet investors are afraid of investing now. This fear is becoming their enemy. It\u2019s time to fetch good quality mid-caps and small-caps with washtubs rather than with teaspoons.  Berkshire AGM would take place on 4<sup>th</sup> May. Many investors from India would attend the same. As an advice, I would recommend every investor to read Buffett\u2019s annual letter. One can find his previous letters addressed to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders on (<a href=\"http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html\">http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html</a>).  I can assure you that after reading these letters, you would be a better investor.  <strong>Sunil Damania </strong>Chief Investment Officer \u2013 Marketsmojo.com <strong> CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate Disclaimer: <em>This blog is only for education purpose.

But not this time. More stocks have advanced as compared to the declining stocks since 14th Feb when the Fedayeen attack on CRPF in Pulwama killed 40 jawans. From BSE 500, only 83 stocks are trading at levels lower than those on 14<sup>th</sup> Feb. How one can explain this movement?  <strong>Likely strong mandate for Modi</strong> The stock market was fearing a fractured mandate in the coming general elections. That\u2019s what pre-election surveys suggested. The market was concerned that a coalition government may not be able to push reforms, impacting long-term growth trajectory of the economy.  After the Pulwama attack, the way Modi government handled the situation suggests that Modi\u2019s popularity is on the rise again. People now believe that the Modi government is walking the talk. It was the first time in many decades that Indian planes went inside Pakistan to carry out <em>Surgical Strike 2 (SS2)</em> on the terrorist camp. This has improved the sentiments as it showed that India is a strong country which would give a befitting reply to the terrorists\u2019 dastardly attacks on Indian soil and that it is no longer a sitting duck.  The increased popularity of the Modi government means that the BJP\u2019s as well as the NDA\u2019s chances of forming the next government has increased manifold. At the same time, the so-called \u2018Mahagathbandhan\u2019 is not going anywhere. In AP, the TDP is all set to go alone. In UP, BSP and SP refused to go along with the Congress. In Rajasthan and MP, where the Congress has seen resurgence recently, the party is unlikely to form an alliance with the BSP and other regional parties, suggesting that there would be no direct fight between the BJP and the Congress. The resultant division of votes means better chances for the BJP and its allies. In Delhi, AAP has announced six candidates for Delhi, suggesting that it would be a three-way fight. In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee is all set to go alone, while there is still no clarity on the CPM-Congress alliance for six Lok Sabha seats. That means there would be a four-way fight between TMC, BJP, CPM and Congress. One thing that looks more certain is that the BJP will improve its tally in West Bengal.  The best chance to beat Modi was a united opposition, but that\u2019s not happening. On the other hand, despite the scathing attacks by the Shiv Sena against the BJP in the past, the party has buried the hatchet and joined hands with the BJP for the Lok Sabha election. In Bihar, the BJP would have allies in the form of JDU and LJP. In AP and Telangana, it looks like the BJP will get support from TRC and YSRCP. In Punjab, Akali Dal and BJP will fight together. In that sense, BJP has been able to work out its equations well with its allies as against the uncertainties surrounding the Mahagathbandhan.  Rahul Gandhi, on the other hand, is not able to spell out his vision for India. There is lack of clarity on his view on economic policy. He seems to be obsessed with the Rafale issue. His incessant rhetoric without any substantial proof of wrongdoings by the NDA may not cut ice with the electorate. The time has come for him to move on from Rafale and come out with stronger issues to take on Modi and his team. After the Pulwama attack, Rafale seems to be an urgent need for the country. Hence, irregularity or not, people want Rafale to make the country\u2019s defence strong.  Rahul Gandhi\u2019s plank for winning the election seems to be to announce more sops, but the moot question is, where would the funds come from? In a sense, the market is now sensing that Modi will have a smooth sailing.  <strong>Strong inflows from FPIs</strong> The FPIs have also started pumping money into the Indian equity market post 14th Feb. They have pumped Rs 11,000 crore since the Pulwama attack. This is a good sign as the FPIs have been constant sellers in the Indian market for quite some time. It is too early to say whether this trend would continue, but what gives comfort is that the FPIs pumped in money when India was on the verge of a war with Pakistan.  This inflow assumes more significance as there was news for quite some time that the MSCI Emerging Markets index is due for a rejig, wherein China\u2019s \u2018A\u2019 shares weightage would be increased, and due to that, India\u2019s weightage would get reduced. Last Friday, MSCI did announce hiking China weightage of \u201cA\u201d shares. This would happen in three phases-May, August and November 2019. As per the note put up by Goldman Sachs, India\u2019s weightage is likely to reduce by 20 basis points, resulting in outflow of $3.8 billion (active as well as passive). The outflows would be seen in large-caps, and not in mid-caps and small-caps.  I have been maintaining in the last two blogs that after the severe correction, the valuations of mid-caps and small-caps have become attractive. In my blog on 21<sup>st</sup> Feb, I wrote, <em>\u201cMany mid-cap and small-cap companies have seen their share prices taking a beating due to the poor market sentiments, thereby making their valuations attractive. These companies could present good buying opportunity for the long term, provided the promoters have no pledged shares and these are zero-debt companies. If these are high dividend yield stocks, then it would be like a cherry on the cake.\u201d</em> I wrote again in my blog dated 27<sup>th</sup> Feb, \u201c<em>Many of the good quality mid-cap and small-cap stocks have taken a huge beating. Their valuations have become very attractive and yet investors are afraid of investing now. This fear is becoming their enemy. It\u2019s time to fetch good quality mid-caps and small-caps with washtubs rather than with teaspoons.\u201d</em> I am happy that mid-caps and small-caps are outperforming. Since Feb 20<sup>th</sup>, Sensex has moved up by 1.92 per cent, but the Midcap index has moved up by 5.73 per cent and the Small cap index by 8.62 per cent. We have not seen this kind of outperformance in the recent past.  I continue to maintain that mid-caps and small-caps would continue to outperform and, hence, it is still not late to board the bus. But you need to keep the criteria for selecting the companies strict as many poor-quality companies have also moved up.  Having said that, one should also expect volatility in the stock indices as the geopolitical situation can flare up as Modi seems to have not done with punishing the terrorists yet. He recently said, \u201cA \u2018pilot project\u2019 is over. Now the real one has to be done. The earlier one was a practice,\u201d suggesting that India\u2019s fight against terrorism is far from over. One can expect more action from India, and Pakistan\u2019s reaction to the same could impact the sentiments. Hence, the geopolitical events can create some nervousness.  But if you have a medium term outlook, I am confident that the mid-caps and small-caps will do well. Happier days are back for these stocks. Time to increase weightages of mid-caps and small-caps in your portfolio.  <strong>Sunil Damania </strong>Chief Investment Officer \u2013 Marketsmojo.com <strong> CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate Disclaimer: <em>This blog is only for education purpose.

How to play the elections?", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/is-the-bull-market-back-how-to-play-the-elections/", "content": "<strong>Research shows that there is no firm pattern during the period between the election announcement date and the day of election results.</strong> Everyone was waiting for the election schedule. On 10<sup>th</sup> March, Sunil Arora, Election Commissioner of India, declared the schedule for the general elections. Elections would start from 11<sup>th</sup> April (less than a month from now) and would end on 19<sup>th</sup>May. The results would be announced on 23<sup>rd</sup> May.  When the election schedule was being announced, I was watching India vs Australia one-day match with one of my friends. He asked me a very pertinent question. How does the market normally behave from the election announcement date till the results are out? This is the period when there would be intense political activities. This is the time for allegations and counter-allegations getting flung around amongst various political parties. This is the time when the manifestoes would be announced, which would give some sense of how each political party intends to run the country over the next five years and what kind of populist measures these parties would announce that can impact the fiscal health of the country.  I had no readymade answer to my friend\u2019s question. I told him that I will come back to him on this after doing some basic research.  The moment my friend left my house, I moved to my desk to do some research on this. To be frank, I had assumed that India will win the match as the score of 358 was tough to chase with India having bowlers like Burmrah, Chahal and Yadav. I stopped watching the match thinking that the outcome was a foregone conclusion. But I was proved wrong as Australia won the match, that too without any tense moments.  My research shows that there is no firm pattern during the period between the election announcement date and the day of election results. In 2004, election schedule was announced on 29<sup>th</sup> Feb and the counting of votes was done on 13<sup>th</sup> May. During this period, Sensex was down by 5 per cent from 5600 level to 5400 level. But 2009 was a different experience altogether as the Sensex moved up by more than 40 per cent from 2<sup>nd</sup> March (Sensex was at 8,607 when the election schedule was announced) to 16<sup>th</sup> May, when the Sensex touched 12,173. But one should not read too much into this gain as the Sensex had lost heavily before this period due to the Lehman crisis.  Then comes 2014 election. At that time, the nation\u2019s mood was very much in favour of Narendra Modi. On 10<sup>th</sup> March, when the election schedule was announced, the Sensex was close to 22,000 level and on 16<sup>th</sup> May, the election result date, it was close to 24,000. A gain of almost 10 per cent.  So, if the past trend is any indicator, it is obvious that the market can provide anywhere between negative 5 per cent returns to 10 per cent positive returns. I have excluded the 2009 scenario as it was not a normal case. Looking at the present situation, I believe the Sensex may move somewhere in the range of -5 to 10 per cent.  But this time, there is one major change. This is the first time after many decades that the Lok Sabha has the possibility of moving from a government with a strong mandate to a coalition government. No political party since 1984 enjoyed a strong majority in the Lok Sabha. So, every five years during election time, there were hopes in the market that we would see a single party government rather than a coalition government. In that sense, this time it is different. This worry will play on the stock market psyche. But I will not give too much importance to this kind of worry.  As it happens during almost every election time, a theory starts floating around suggesting that if a particular party/alliance comes to power, certain sectors or business houses would benefit. I would suggest not to listen to these kind of stories. The reality is quite different. Just take the case of the PSU sector. Before 2014 election, there was a buzz that the PSU sector would be re-rated if Modi comes to power. But the reality is that the PSU companies in the last five years did not give any meaningful returns. The PSU Index in the last five years gave CAGR return of 2.23 per cent. There was also the theory floating around during the last election time that the Adani group companies were a good buy due to the alleged proximity of Adani to Modi. But the reality is that in the last five years, the Adani group\u2019s total market cap (after adjusting all demergers) grew at four per cent CAGR.  Rahul Gandhi has alleged that Anil Ambani has been favored by the Modi government, but the fact is that the Anil Ambani group has seen a massive erosion in its market cap in the last five years.  <strong>So what strategy one should adopt?</strong> I would advise you to ignore political noise. Newspapers, magazines and news channels would be debating intensively on the election results. Don\u2019t give much importance to the same. I would continue to add/buy companies where I see the valuation right, irrespective of which party/alliance forms the next government. I continue to see value in many of the mid-caps and small-caps. I would continue to chase them. At the same time, many mid-caps and small-caps have run up quite significantly. They have become expensive and call for caution. Wait for the right levels to enter in these companies.  While election noise will impact the market sentiment, one should not ignore international events. The Brexit final date is approaching fast and there is still lack of clarity on how Brexit would take place. At the same time, market would also factor in resolution (or non-resolution) of the trade war between the US and China.  The crude oil price, which started moving down during the fag end of 2018, is again on the rise. In 2019, it has moved up by 22 per cent. If this trend continues, it would be tough for the government to manage. Higher crude oil prices and, in turn, higher petrol and diesel prices can go against the incumbent government. Absorbing the same would mean the fiscal situation would worsen.  If you are confused and unsure of what to do on account of political noise, I would suggest staying away from the market. But under no circumstances would I advise the investors to move out from the equity market.  Just one line of caution before I sign off this piece.  India was certain to win Sunday\u2019s one-day match but lost it. The same way, election results could also surprise. Even a week is too long a period in politics. Hence, don\u2019t take investment decisions based on one political party forming the government. Your decision to buy stocks should be a function of fundamentals of the company. This is what I would be doing in the next two months.  &nbsp; <strong>Sunil Damania </strong> <em>@sunildamania</em> <strong> CREDENT ASSET \u2013 Invest your belief in us</strong> Startups | SME | Equity | Mutual Funds | Real Estate Disclaimer: <em>This blog is only for education purpose.

For years, we, as voters, have heard promises from our administrators of better infrastructure \u2013 fewer potholes, fewer electricity outages, less traffic congestion, clean water.  However, infrastructure development typically involves high levels of upfront financial investment, given the heavy capital expenditure required during the construction stage. Infrastructure projects carry an array of risks which can lead to cost overruns and reduce financial returns. Roughly 27% of the nearly 1500 infrastructure projects being undertaken by the Central government are running behind schedule, while about 20% have overshot original cost <a href=\"http://www.cspm.gov.in/english/qr/jul-sep_2018.pdf\">estimates.</a> As a result, mobilizing and structuring financing for infrastructure development is a complex proposition. So how are we to attain the promised <em>Bijli, paani</em> and <em>sadak</em>?  India\u2019s infrastructure financing requirement ranges anywhere between US$ 150 \u2013 US$ 300 billion per annum (figure 1). These headline estimates mask considerable variations in requirements. States with high population densities, such as, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand, and the North-Eastern region, which has lower population density and hilly terrain, are likely to have higher infrastructure <a href=\"http://www.ncaer.org/uploads/photo-gallery/files/1500629311N-SIPI_2017.pdf\">needs</a>. Further, infrastructure designed for climate adaptation, and using smart technology-based solutions is likely to drive demand. Therefore, new sources and modalities of financing need to be unlocked, to meet the widening infrastructure gaps in the medium term.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1653\"src=\"https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Blog-Pic-1.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"679\"height=\"296\"/> &nbsp; Given this context, there are three key strategic areas which should be prioritized for efficient deployment of the limited resources: (i) catalyzing public private partnerships (PPP) through the implementation of the Kelkar Committee reforms; (ii) enhancing investments in smart infrastructure solutions; and (iii) capacity building through a \u2018learning-by-doing\u2019 approach for improving the utilization of infrastructure financing.  Each of these are discussed in this article.  <h4>Focus areas for infrastructure financing</h4> <h4>\u00b7        Renewed push for infrastructure financing from the private sector</h4> Traditionally, infrastructure financing in India has been dominated by the public sector. During the twelfth five-year plan period (2012-17), target was to leverage private infrastructure investments equivalent to 3.9% of <a href=\"http://niti.gov.in/content/appraisal-document-twelfth-five-year-plan-2012-17\">GDP</a>. However, actual investments were considerably lower than planned (figure 2).  &nbsp; <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1654\"src=\"https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Blog-Pic-2.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"702\"height=\"214\"/> &nbsp; Though private investments started rising consistently between 2007 \u2013 2012, they then showed a structural shift downwards during <a href=\"https://ndma.gov.in/iwdri/ppts/16jan/TS%203A/IWDRI2018_TS3A_Yellurkar_IDFC.pdf\">2013 \u2013 2016</a>. This fall was accompanied by a decline in public investments, thereby demonstrating that public investments continue to play a central role in leveraging private investments for infrastructure projects. In light of fiscal expenditure constraints both at Central and State level, there is an urgent need to improve the leverage ratio of public to private sector investments.  <img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1655\"src=\"https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Blog-Pic-3.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"590\"height=\"300\"/> &nbsp; The falling private sector investments can also be attributed to difficulties in accessing finance, most notably falling bank credit to infrastructure companies. As total non-performing assets (NPAs) doubled from 4.3% of total advances in March 2015 to 9.6% in March 2017, share of infrastructure in total bank credit fell from 15.4% to 12.7%. Further, total PPP investments in India fell from US$ 53.3 billion in 2010 to US$ 4.1 billion in 2015, recovering only marginally to US$ 4.8 billion in 2017.  In such a scenario, risk allocation mechanisms and PPP models should be reviewed on a sector-by-sector basis, to reassure investors that the public sector stands to take adequate risk to ensure project viability. For instance, the introduction of the hybrid annuity model (HAM) in the roads sector, led to a significant increase in projects awarded, accounting for 63% of total value in 2017-18.  The <em>Committee on Revisiting and Revitalising the PPP model of infrastructure development</em>(Kelkar Committee) provided a comprehensive reforms agenda, including establishing sector-specific regulators, dispute resolution mechanisms, and a national PPP policy, <a href=\"https://www.pppinindia.gov.in/infrastructureindia/documents/10184/0/kelkar+Pdf/0d6ffb64-4501-42ba-a083-ca3ce99cf999\">amongst others</a>. However, since the submission of the Kelkar Committee report in November 2015, little has been done. An accountability mechanism needs to be established urgently to devise a phased approach for the implementation of these reforms.  <h4>Increased focus on smart infrastructure</h4> The Smart Cities Mission (SCM) was launched in 2015 for developing 100 \u2018smart cities\u2019 around the country by 2022. The SCM mandates that information technology (IT) and digitization should form a core part of the infrastructure in a smart city. However, the implementation of the SCM has been slower than planned, with only 1.8% of the total allocated funds being utilized till <a href=\"http://164.100.47.193/lsscommittee/Urban%20Development/16_Urban_Development_23.pdf\">March 2018</a>.  The fourth industrial revolution (4IR) is a digital revolution, evolving at an exponential pace, disrupting established processes across industries and sectors. India is vastly underprepared to reap the benefits of the 4IR owing to a severe lack of telecom and digital infrastructure required to support smart infrastructure solutions. India needs to mainstream technology intensive infrastructure solutions in capital-intensive sectors \u2013 such as smart grids for power distribution, predictive maintenance systems for railways, national highways and airport runways, automatic warehousing for multi-modal logistics parks, amongst others. This requires predictable policy and regulatory frameworks to incentivize private sector, and forge long-term partnerships to encourage innovation.  <h4>Improving utilization of financing through capacity development</h4> The efficient utilization of infrastructure financing \u2013 regardless of source \u2013 requires the project sponsor to lead implementation proficiently. Despite the proliferation of implementation guidelines and model concession agreements, there is still a need to, \u201c<em>build up capacity in all stakeholders, including regulators, authority, consultants, financing agencies, developers\u201d </em>for the successful execution of PPP projects (Kelkar Committee report).  While the Kelkar Committee has recommended establishing an institution dedicated to capacity building at the Central level, this institute must also provide training for officials at the State and sub-State levels who are actually involved in project implementation. Further, learning-by-doing modalities need to developed so that officials work in close collaboration with technical specialists and experienced consultants on a medium-term basis.  It is essential to build capacities of ground-level implementation officials so that they are comfortable with using mobile based applications for monitoring project progress. Specifically, there is a need to generalize the use of geotagging, so that after the data is captured, it can be synced to a central server to generate an analysis of progress on the field. The data on the central dashboard can be audited by internal and external evaluators.  <h4>Conclusion</h4> As each political party makes tall promises of bringing back jobs, there is an urgent need to re-prioritize infrastructure development as the backbone of economic growth. And actually realise the promises of \u2013 <em>pakki sadak, saaf paani, and niyamit bijli</em>.  &nbsp; DISCLAIMER : Views expressed above are the author's own. <em>This blog is only for education purpose.

However, the real estate sector has been grappling with a slowdown triggered by various issues, including the Goods and Service Tax (GST). Some of the issues are higher tax rates on inputs such as cement (taxed at 28 percent) which lead to an accumulation of input tax credit (ITC), developers not passing the benefit of ITC to customers, high GST rate (i.e. effective rate of 8 percent and 12 percent on affordable housing and other housing categories, respectively), levy of GST on certain transactions like Transferable Development Rights (TDR), Joint Development Agreement (JDA), etc.  Reduction of GST rates has been a long-pending demand from real estate players, including industry associations such as the Confederation of Real Estate Developers\u2019 Association of India (CREDAI) and the National Real Estate Development Council (NREDC).  The GST Council, in order to address the aforesaid issues, made certain announcements at its 33<sup>rd</sup> and 34<sup>th</sup> meetings held on 24 February and 19 March 2019, respectively. The key decisions taken during the 33<sup>rd</sup> meeting, broadly based on recommendations of a ministerial panel led by Gujarat deputy chief minister Nitin Patel, are: <ul> <li>GST on affordable housing properties lowered from an effective rate of 8 percent to 1 percent (without ITC). Properties of carpet area of up to 90 square meters in non-metropolitan cities/towns and 60 square meters in metropolitan cities having value up to Rs 45 lakh would qualify as affordable housing.</li> <li>GST on other than affordable housing properties lowered from an effective rate of 12 percent to 5 percent (without ITC).</li> <li>Exemption provided from GST on TDR, JDA, Floor Space Index (FSI) and long term lease premium for residential properties on which GST is payable.</li> </ul> <strong>Further, the GST Council at its 34th meeting approved the modalities of transition to the new tax structure. Some of the key decisions taken at the meeting include the following:</strong> <ul> <li>In case of ongoing projects (buildings where construction and actual booking have both started before 1 April 2019) which have not been completed by 31 March 2019, developers would be given a one-time option to pay tax at the old rates (i.e. 8 percent/ 12 percent with ITC). The option would need to be exercised within a prescribed time frame (to be notified) failing which the new rates would apply.</li> <li>In order to avail the benefit of reduced new tax rates, a condition of 80 percent of procurement of inputs and input services (other than capital goods, TDR/ JDA, FSI, long term lease premium) from registered persons, has been stipulated. On shortfall of 80percent purchases, GST shall be payable by the developer on reverse charge mechanism basis, on procurements from unregistered persons.</li> <li>Proportionate ITC to be allowed as per a prescribed formula in case of ongoing projects transitioning to new tax rates.</li> <li>ITC rules to be amended to bring greater clarity of determination of ITC and reversal for real estate projects.</li> </ul> &nbsp; With these announcements, the government has tried to address key concerns of the sector. The GST rate reduction on under-construction properties is expected to uplift the sentiments of home buyers. On the flip side, the move may hit profit margins of developers due to a withdrawal of ITC and non-reduction of GST rate on cement (28 percent) leading to increase in the cost of construction which may be passed on to home-buyers.  Further, putting a restriction on the availability of ITC is against the fundamental principle of GST, i.e. seamless flow of credit. A slightly higher rate with the facility of ITC could be a better option.  Also, concerns have been raised that the new tax rates would not apply to work carried out by the developer for old housing societies and Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), which would continue to be taxed at 12 percent and 18 percent, even after 1 April 2019, which may adversely impact the interests of weaker and middle-income groups.  The reduction in GST rates, along with direct tax incentives proposed for the real estate sector in the Union Budget (such as extension of deductions from income to developers of affordable housing projects by one year and extension of the period of exemption from levy of tax on notional rent on unsold inventories from one year to two years), shows the government\u2019s commitment towards its agenda of promoting affordable housing and giving a fillip to the real estate sector.  <strong>Conclusion: </strong> With the new rates being implemented, Higher GST with ITC or Lower GST without ITC, is a call that developers will have to make depending on their liquidity and as going forward, if the developers choose a new reigme, it is likely to mean an increase in the cost of construction. This will create a lesser impact to the Real Estate Fraternity as it is a choice given to the developers which they have to make depending on their feasibility factors.  <strong>However in the entire scenario, the end User \u2013 \u201cHOME BUYER\u201d will be highly benefited.</strong> <strong> </strong> <strong>DISCLAIMER: Views expressed above are the author\u2019s own. <em>This blog is only for education purpose.

The RBI introduced this tool in February 2015, and since then the regulator announces its decision on CCCB in the first bi-monthly policy of the financial year.  Banking activity is largely seen as pro-cyclical which means bank financing rises and declines with the level of economic activity. This is problematic as it is at the time of downturns that economies need support from banks since other sources of finance dry up significantly.  Apart from just banks, one can also raise finances from other resources during good times. Thus, banks need to do the opposite: apply restraint during good times and go for broke during bad times. This is the countercyclical approach.  However, counter-cyclicality is difficult to apply in principle. During good times, banks, too, want to join the growth story and, if reluctant, they might be pushed by their shareholders to do so. The former Citigroup chief executive officer, Chuck Prince famously said: \u201cWhen the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated. But as long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance. We're still dancing.\u201d These remarks came to haunt him during the 2008 crisis, but all he said was a reflection of the larger financial industry.  Under CCCB, banks are required to maintain a buffer as the economy is growing and then use the same during a downturn. Another linked purpose of the CCCB is that it becomes part of the macro-prudential toolkit of central banks and other regulators.  Before the crisis, one just looked at risks in individual banks (micro-prudential). Post the 2008 crisis, it was learnt that even if individual banks are doing fine, they could be creating problems at a systemic level. For instance, most US-based banks were increasingly reliant on the repo window for meeting their liabilities and they looked stable. However, at an aggregate level, this created a systemic risk as everyone was dependent on short-term borrowings which eventually led to the 2008 crisis. This resulted in a change in thinking that regulators also need to look at risks in the entire system. Interestingly, the Great Depression gave us macroeconomics whereas 2008 crisis gave us macro-prudential!  One crucial thing to understand is how the CCCB gets activated. In Feb 2018, the RBI gave the following guidelines for its estimation: \u201cThe credit-to-GDP gap shall be the main indicator in the CCCB framework in India. However, it shall not be the only reference point and shall be used in conjunction with gross non-performing assets (GNPA) growth. The Reserve Bank of India shall also look at other supplementary indicators for CCCB decision such as incremental credit-deposit ratio for a moving period of three years (along with its correlation with credit-to-GDP gap and GNPA growth), industry outlook (IO) assessment index (along with its correlation with GNPA growth) and interest coverage ratio (along with its correlation with credit-to-GDP gap). While taking the final decision on CCCB, the Reserve Bank of India may use its discretion to use all or some of the indicators along with the credit-to-GDP gap.\u201d The credit to GDP gap which is the main indicator is defined as the \u201cdifference between credit-to-GDP ratio and the long term trend value of credit-to-GDP ratio at any point in time.\u201d Further, the RBI has specified two thresholds activating the CCCB: 3 percent and 15 percent. This means when actual credit to GDP is greater than the long-term trend by 3 percent, CCCB of 0 to 0.25 percent of risk-weighted assets (RWA) will be activated. The upper threshold is 15 percent greater than the long-term trend where maximum CCCB of 2.5 percent of RWA will apply. In the middle of this range, the regulator will keep prescribing a raise in CCCB from 0 to 0.25 percent of RWA till it reaches 2.5 percent.  There are statistical approaches to estimating long-term trend which can help in estimating the gap. However, BIS in its 2010 report said: \u201csimple moving average or a linear time trend could be used to establish the trend\u201d.  Applying a moving average of three years, the gap is clearly negative as of now. Perhaps, the only time CCCB would have been applied is in the period of 2004-08 when Indian banking suddenly shifted gears from lazy banking in 2002 (as mentioned by Rakesh Mohan former Deputy Governor of RBI in 2002) to crazy banking in 2004-08 (as suggested by some  experts) Since then, the gap declined and has been negative since 2014-15.  <img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1682\"src=\"https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/111.png\"alt=\"\"width=\"424\"height=\"256\"/> BIS also announced that banks of member economies could begin building CCCBs as part of their capital plans. If activated, the banks would be asked to keep 0.625 percent of RWA in January 2016 and increase this year to reach 2.5 percent by January 2019. The above-explained activation would be discretionary and the power lies with the national regulator. RBI agrees to this BIS advisory and has asked Indian banks to start maintaining CCCBs. This became a bone of contention amidst banks as it required them to raise resources other than normal capital. The issue came up in a controversial RBI Board meeting in December 2018, where it was decided to delay the last tranche of 0.625 percent by a year. Obviously, only time will tell whether CCCBs are enough to both prevent and mitigate the next financial crisis.  <strong>(Amol Agrawal is faculty at Ahmedabad University.

The tables still remain empty during lunch hour, but now there\u2019s a horde of smartphone toting delivery boys in the orange and scarlet colours of Swiggy and Zomato.  Quick service restaurant (QSR, or fast-food) chains in India didn\u2019t have that option before. If consumers didn\u2019t walk in, they were sitting ducks in a highly price-sensitive market. With only 5% of their overall sales coming from deliveries ordered through call centres, several had to shut hundreds of outlets in 2016-17 when same-store sales growth (SSG) plunged to record lows.  Two years later, deliveries contribute 20-25% to the overall sales of most QSR chains. Call centres have all but faded into oblivion. Pick-up kiosks catering to online delivery platforms, including Zomato, Foodpanda and Swiggy, have sprung up in their place.  \u201cThere was talk of the outlet being shut down as we weren\u2019t getting enough walk-in customers. We were scared of losing our jobs,\u201d the burger outlet\u2019s manager told <strong>TOI</strong>. \u201cThen online delivery orders from Zomato and Swiggy started picking up. These companies have come as a boon for us. Currently, more than 50% of sales of this outlet comes from deliveries as there are several offices in the area.\u201d Companies, too, are reporting healthy numbers. India\u2019s largest pizza chain, Dominos, which showed a negative SSG of 7.5% in January-March 2017, reported an SSG of 13.5% in 2018. KFC, which reported a 2% system sales growth in Jan-March 2017, showed a growth of 25% in July-September, 2018.  \u201cThere has been exponential growth in deliveries since the time online aggregators came into the market. Our incremental sales through deliveries have jumped five times compared to what we were doing three years ago. And only one-fifth of that comes from our call centres at present. The rest is through online orders,\u201d said Akshay Jatia, GM, brand extensions, at Hardcastle Restaurants, master franchisee of US burger chain McDonald\u2019s in West and South India.  Senior executives at Domino\u2019s echoed similar sentiments. \u201cOrdering-in is the new eating-out,\u201d the company said in its latest annual report. Two years ago, 46% of deliveries were booked online. Today, it has increased to 58%. Also, around 74% of online orders are now placed on smartphones, compared to 57% in 2016-17.  \u201cOnline deliveries are compensating for the lack of hyper-growth in the QSR space. What\u2019s interesting is that volume growth in dine-in is stable at 5-8% across the industry, which means online sales are not cannibalising walk-in numbers,\u201d said Rakesh Ranjan, VP of food delivery at Zomato, which has witnessed orders from QSRs on its platform grow eight times in two years.  Not only are more people ordering pizza, kulfi and even tea online, QSR chains are getting more repeat orders too, thanks to restaurant aggregators that are burning cash to drive higher gross merchandise value (GMV). Zomato, for instance, currently loses Rs 25 per delivery compared to Rs 44 last year.  \u201cWe are seeing a repeat rate of around 58% in 60 days compared to a repeat rate of 30% a year ago, which means 58% of our customers order again within a period of two months,\u201d said Kabir Jeet Singh, founder and CEO of homegrown burger chain Burger Singh, which is set to open 100 new outlets by 2022. Interestingly, online orders contribute 75% to Burger Singh\u2019s overall revenues at present, up from 50% a year ago.  The online lure has prompted several large QSR chains, including KFC, to venture into cloud kitchens that help operators prepare, pack and deliver food without any dine-in facility. Compared to 1,500 square feet for a full-blown outlet, a cloud kitchen can be housed in a space of 250-300 square feet. \u201cThe order penetration of cloud kitchens on our platform was less than 1% two years ago. Currently, it has grown to 8-10% with new brands taking away share from the established players,\u201d said Zomato\u2019s Ranjan.  A Swiggy delivery boy in South Delhi told <strong>TOI</strong> that he has been getting queries from several small restaurant owners about cloud kitchens. \u201cThese restaurants hardly get any walk-ins and have only a couple of chairs and tables. But they are doing brisk business through Swiggy and Zomato. And they are very curious to know how the cloud kitchen model works because they are thinking of expanding to other cities as well,\u201d he said.  The cloud kitchen model not only helps bring down rent-to-sales ratio for a company as the cost of rentals and manpower decreases, it also reduces the price for the consumer. Sequoia backed Rebel Foods, which operates more than 160 cloud kitchens with brands such as Faasos and Behrouz Biryani, delivered same kitchen sales growth of more than 75% in FY18 compared to the industry average of 10-15% SSG.  And this is just the beginning. Online orders worth around $1.7 billion were placed in India, in 2018 \u2014 more than twice as many as a year ago. By 2020, the market is set to double again to $3 billion a year, according to Red-Seer Consulting.  \u201cPackaging has been a major investment for us because we had to figure out how to deliver piping hot tea in a smart manner. That\u2019s how seriously we take deliveries which contribute around 22% to our topline. With the aggregators getting better at their game, the onus to up the ante now lies with us,\u201d said Nitin Saluja, founder of tea caf\u00e9 chain Chaayos that currently operates 58 outlets in India.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1689\"src=\"https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/aaa.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"514\"height=\"498\"/> Article by: <a href=\"mailto:JOHN.SARKAR@TIMESGROUP.COM\">JOHN.SARKAR@TIMESGROUP.COM</a> Disclaimer: <strong>Views expressed above are the author\u2019s own. <em>This blog is only for education purpose.

This is in contrast to the previous decade when many central banks were cutting back on gold. So is something happening? Central banks' love for the yellow metal has in turn made gold speculators in Dubai quite bullish.  *<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The objective of this column is not to recommend gold as an asset, but to point out the ripple effect central bank gold purchases have caused.  Between 2010-19 total gold purchased by central banks was 3,560.28 tonnes. The only exception was Germany which sold 37 tonnes. The top 18 gold owning central banks accounted for purchases of 2,628 tonnes. The biggest among them was Russia, followed by China. India too purchased 50.94 tonnes.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1694\"src=\"https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/aaaaa.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"271\"height=\"722\"/> So why are central banks purchasing gold? The standard answer given by central bankers that gold is part of a basket of currencies each country has to hold, as part of its foreign exchange reserves.  But there are unstated reasons as well. Many countries have begun to feel that holding too many US dollars as part of their reserves could be risky. They are expecting turbulence in forex markets shortly.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1695\"src=\"https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bbbb.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"778\"height=\"583\"/> They point to the increasing role of non-dollar trades. While it is difficult to put a finger on the exact role each currency plays in world trade \u2013 some of the trades have in-built political give-and-takes structured as part of such deals \u2013 a good indication can be found from figures released by Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER), International Financial Statistics (IFS).  The numbers show that just euro and renminbi trade swelled from 17.51 percent of total global foreign exchange reserves to 21.21 percent during just seven quarters from Q2 2017 to Q4 2018. But when allocated reserves (which are around 83-94 percent of total forex reserves) are taken into account, the share of the Euro and Renminbi soars even further.  Their share climbed from 21.03 percent to 22.58 percent during the same period. This is without considering the yen or the pound sterling, because they are unlikely to become global currencies. Clearly, the US dollar is losing its clout in global trade in a growing market.  With neither the euro nor the renminbi yet ready to assume the mantle of becoming a global currency, many banks prefer reducing their exposure to the US dollar, and have begun focusing more on gold which is relatively neutral when it comes to geographic loyalties. However, the US, a major gold owning country, chose not to purchase gold during the past decade. It would appear that it did not want to give more weight to gold at the cost of its own global supremacy. Germany, another major gold owning country sold 37 tonnes of gold. But that could be explained away because Germany already has too much of gold in its reserves.  In fact, both the US and Germany \u2013 both economic powerhouses in the global economy \u2013 have tremendous (though unstated) confidence in gold. This yellow metal already accounts for as much as 70.6 percent share in Germany\u2019s forex reserves. In the case of the US, it is even higher, at 74.9 percent. India\u2019s holdings in gold stand at just 6.4 percent of its reserves. This low figure points to an urgent need for India to revise its gold policies and start building its gold reserves without resorting to global purchases. One way would be to liberalize gold mining policies.  Another way would be to introduce better versions of gold bonds. After all, various estimates put India\u2019s gold holdings (in private hands) at 20,000 tonnes to 25,000 tonnes, the largest in the world.  Expect both Russia and China to start scaling the list of top gold holders given their aggressive purchases during the past decade. Russia has an added advantage. It is believed to have the highest reserves of (as yet unmined) gold in the world.  Also expect, the US dollar to continue losing its share in global commerce because of three reasons. First is obviously the emerging economic heft of China. Second is the stupid moves the US has itself made, explained a bit later. A third reason could be the declining relevance of oil, thanks to solar and other renewable sources of energy. It is always worth remembering that the US is a major player in oil markets as well, both directly as well as through its various oil companies.  That the US has made unwise moves can be seen from the manner in which it tried to sanction oil exports from Russia to Europe. That move made Russia swiftly clinch an oil and gas trade deal with China and build an oil pipeline to this dragon country. That, in turn reduced China\u2019s vulnerability to both Middle East and US based energy markets, and caused a substantial amount of trade to move away from US dollars.  A similar situation is happening with Iran as well. Trying to impose (unilateral) sanctions against Iranian oil, will replay a similar scenario. It will push Iran to sell more oil to China, which always needs increasing amounts of energy as it grows in industrial strength. That will reduce the share of US dollar denominated trade further.  It won\u2019t be long before India too might have to move this way, if it wants to bridge the growing trade balance with China which has already emerged as its largest trading partner. As time goes by, trade between India and China is bound to grow \u2013 partly on account of geographical proximity, much in the same way US-Canada trade ties have swelled over the past several decades, and partly because of business negotiations.  India\u2019s defence deals with Russia are also likely to reduce dollar denominated trade, and this scenario could get replicated in several ways around the globe. China\u2019s predominance in the telecom sector \u2013 remember 5G \u2013 could further accelerate the move away from the US dollar. That could also explain the ire of the US over China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which again gets into non-dollar deals.  As the dollar loses market share, expect turbulence in currency markets to increase. That will push more central banks towards gold. Will this mean a gold rush? That is hard to say because gold prices are also a result of hedging and de-hedging strategies adopted by gold mining companies.  But one thing is certain. Gold is becoming more relevant to central banks than a decade ago. The lust for gold will thus remain undiminished.  <strong>The author is consulting editor with Moneycontrol.com</strong> <strong> </strong><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <strong>Views expressed above are the author\u2019s own. <em>This blog is only for education purpose.

India\u2019s \u201cNational Trade Facilitation Action Plan 2017-20\u201d proposed to bring down the time to the same day for clearance of export cargo and two days for import cargo by air.  The express delivery industry, which provides integrated door-to-door transport and quick delivery of time-sensitive shipments play a crucial role in not only meeting the target set by the \u201cNational Trade Facilitation Action Plan 2017-20\u201d but also in improving the efficiency and global competitiveness of Indian businesses.  India has a fairly robust express delivery sector. According to a study by Deloitte, the industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 17 percent between 2017 and 2022. In the financial year 2017, this sector employed around 1.6 million workers and contributed close to Rs 2,000 crores to customs duties. With the majority of users being small and medium-sized companies across sectors, such as pharmaceutical and agro-processing, who rely on this sector for transporting their samples and high-value consignments, the express industry will continue to play a key role in India\u2019s international trade.  In the past decade, a number of measures have been taken to support the growth of the express industry and enhance its contribution to international trade. This includes implementation of electronic data interchange at leading international terminals in India. The express industry and their associations Express Industry Council of India (EICI) have worked closely with the Indian government to implement ECCS\u2014the express cargo clearance system, which follows a paperless system. Express terminals for cargo clearances have been set up in cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Ahmadabad and Bangalore.  Despite these developments and investments in the development of infrastructure, a number of small and medium enterprises and their exporters and importers suddenly started facing a new trade barrier. The customs in a leading airport of India citing the Courier Imports and Exports (Electronic Data and Processing) Regulations, 2010, banned all perishable through the courier or fast track route in December 2018. This led to a sudden stop in clearances of blood samples for testing, access to key medicines, exports and imports of food samples for test marketing and display in exhibitions, to name a few. After significant representation by the industry and reviewing the adverse impact on human life, the customs in February 2019 allowed courier companies to transport blood samples subject to requisite clearances by other government departments.  Restrictions on perishable through the fast track route not only lead to huge business losses for the exporters, importers and the express industry, but it is also against India\u2019s initiative to implement the World Trade Organization\u2019s (WTO) Agreement on Trade Facilitation. India is a signatory to Article 7, Section 8 of that agreement on \u201cExpedited Shipments\u201d which calls for member states to \u201cadopt or maintain procedures allowing for the expedited release of at least those goods entered through air cargo facilities<em>\u201d. </em>Since other countries are promoting express delivery and fast track clearances for perishables, Indian business are at a disadvantage.  <em> </em>If one dwells deep into the root cause of the ban on perishable cargo clearance through the fast track route, laws governing the movement of goods through the air cargo route were initially governed by the Courier Exports and Imports (Clearance) Regulations, 1998. Back then, courier did not have a specific terminal and it was cleared in the passenger terminal. Over time, express companies and their association have built terminals, but the ban on the movement of perishables <em>via</em> the air cargo route continued. Subsequently, the Courier Imports and Exports (Electronic Data and Processing) Regulations, 2010, continued to ban perishables. In the light of the need for fast track movement of perishable cargo and for improving the ease of doing business, it is important to amend the 2010 regulation and remove the restriction on perishable cargo movement through the courier or express route subject to requisite clearances by the other clearance agencies, such as <em>Drug</em> Controller and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). In other words, there should not be any restriction on the mode by which the cargo is brought into the country or exported (by air or sea or through logistics or express delivery) as long as it goes through the proper testing and due diligence process In the context of clearance of perishable through express mode, a survey conducted by the authors found that there is no clarity on the definition of perishable and it encompassed all goods which require testing and clearances by the requisite government bodies. Thus, perishable became all-encompassing from chocolates to biscuits to medicine and cosmetics. If a fast track mode is discriminated against for clearance of such a wide range of cargo needless to say that it will have an adverse impact on exporters.  It is important that all consignments through any route should adhere to due diligence such as product testing and getting product specific clearances from requisite authorities. The express industry is willing to go through the due diligence process as logistics providers. The benefit of express cargo is that it is fast track and offers an integrated service to the clients <em>vis-a-vis </em>logistics. As India is implementing trade facilitation and is trying to improve ease of doing business, it is important to amend the 2010 regulation and allow the entry of perishable cargo through the fast track route, subject to testing and other requirements as is applicable to logistics.  There is also a need to have a robust back-end IT infrastructure which will link customs with other clearance agencies. If this is done, India will not only improve its rank in the cross-country comparative indices but logistics costs of doing business will decline significantly. It will especially help our exports in key sectors, such as pharmaceutical and agriculture exports, which constitutes of a number of perishable items.  <h4><strong>Author: Arpita Mukherjee and Angana Parashar Sarma are</strong><em>, </em><strong>respectively,</strong><em> </em><strong>Professor and Research Assistant at ICRIER.</strong></h4> <strong> </strong><strong>Disclaimer: </strong> <strong>Views expressed above are the author\u2019s own. </strong><em><strong>This blog is only for education purpose.

This same question now vexes the technology field. In the online world, once expected to be a place of ready information and easy collaboration, lies and hate can spread faster than truth and kindness. Corporate systems, too, elicit irrational behavior. For example, when predicting sales, employees often hide bad deals and selectively report the good ones. AI stands at the crossroads of the behavioral question, with the potential to make matters worse or to elicit better outcomes from us. The key to better outcomes is to boost AI\u2019s emotional quotient \u2014 it\u2019s EQ. How? By training algorithms to mimic the way people behave in constructive relationships.  Whether or not we care to admit it, we build relationships with apps. And apps, like people, can elicit both positive and negative behaviors from us. When people with high EQ interact with us, they learn our patterns, empathize with our motivations, and carefully weigh their responses. They decide to ignore, challenge, or encourage us depending on how they anticipate we will react.  AI can be trained to do the same thing. Why? Because behaviors are more predictable than we like to think. The $70 billion weight-loss industry thrives because diet companies know that most people regain lost weight. The $40 billion casino industry profits from gamblers\u2019 illogical hope of a comeback. Credit card companies know it is hard for people to break their spending habits.  While it\u2019s still quite early, the fields of behavioral science and machine learning already provide some promising techniques for creating higher-EQ AI that organizations are putting to work to produce better outcomes. Those techniques include: <strong>Noting pattern breaks and nudging. </strong> People who know you can easily tell when you are breaking a pattern and react accordingly. For example, a friend may notice that you suddenly changed your routine and ask you why. The Bank of America online bill paying system similarly notes pattern breaks to prevent user keying errors. The system remembers the pattern of payments you\u2019ve made in the past and posts an alert if you substantially increase your payment to a vendor.  <strong>Encouraging self-awareness with benchmarks.</strong> Bluntly telling individuals they are performing poorly often backfires, provoking defensiveness rather than greater effort. A more diplomatic method simply allows people to see how they compare with others. For instance, a major technology firm used AI to generate more accurate sales forecasts than the sales team did. To induce the team to course-correct, the system provides each team member with personalized visualizations showing how their forecasts differ from the AI forecast. A simple nudge then inquires why this might be the case. The team member can provide a rational explanation, avoid providing feedback, or claim that the AI is incorrect. The AI learns about the substance and timing of the individual\u2019s reaction, weighs it against the gap in the two forecasts, and can choose an appropriate second-order nudge.  <strong>Using game theory to accept or challenge conclusions.</strong> Imagine being on a team that must find errors in over 100,000 mutual fund transactions a day. A fund managing a trillion dollars in assets is tackling this daunting problem with AI. The first version of the AI scored potential errors (called \u201canomalies\u201d) by risk and potential cost, then queued the riskiest anomalies first. The system then tracked the time the analyst spent on each anomaly. It was assumed that analysts would spend more time on the risker anomalies and less time on the \u201cno-brainers.\u201d In fact, some analysts were flying through the riskiest anomalies, reaching suspiciously fast conclusions.  In most massive screening systems, the rate of false positives is often extremely high. For example, secret teams from the Department of Homeland Security found that the TSA failed to stop 95% of inspectors\u2019 attempts to smuggle weapons or explosive materials through screening. Mutual fund analysts scouring countless transactions, like TSA screeners dealing with thousands of passengers, their eyes glazing over, simply glide over anomalies.  The fund is tackling this dangerous, though highly predictable, behavior with an algorithm employed by chess playing programs. This modified version of sequential game theory first monitors whether the analyst concludes that an anomaly is a false positive or decides to spend more time on it. The AI, playing the role of a chess opponent, can decide to counter by accepting the analyst\u2019s decision or challenging it.  <strong>Choosing the right time for insight and action.</strong> By any standard, Jeff Bezos is a master decision maker. In a recent interview with Bloomberg TV\u2019s David Rubenstein, he described his framework for making decisions. When approached about a complex decision late in the afternoon he often replies, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a 4 o\u2019clock decision; that sounds like a 9 o\u2019clock [in the morning] decision.\u201d My firm\u2019s sales team A/B tested the right time of day to maximize responses to prospecting emails and found a dramatic difference in response rates between messages sent Tuesday morning and Friday afternoon. Many consumer messaging systems are tuned to maximize yield. The tuning algorithm can be enhanced to determine the type of decision to be made and the tendency of users to respond and make better choices. For example, decisions that need more thought could be presented at a time when the decision maker has more time to think \u2014 either through prediction or by the user\u2019s scheduling.  Could higher-EQ AI help bring more civility to the internet? Social media companies might do well to consider a distinction Western business people soon learn when negotiating with their Japanese counterparts \u2014 \u201chonne\u201d (what one feels inside) versus \u201ctatemae\u201d (what one publicly expresses). A shared understanding of the distinction between what one feels and what one is expected to say leads to fewer miscalculations. An algorithm based on that distinction might conceivably be developed to address the predictable tendencies of people to say and do things under the influence of crowds (even if virtual ones) that they would otherwise hesitate to do. Someone preparing an inflammatory, misleading, or cruel post might be nudged to reconsider their language or to notice the mob-like tenor of a \u201ctrending\u201d topic. The challenges of developing such emotionally charged, high-EQ AI are daunting, but instead of simply weeding out individual posts it might ultimately be more beneficial to change online behavior for the better.  <strong>Author: </strong><strong>Bob Suh</strong><strong>, Founder and CEO of OnCorps.</strong> <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <strong>Views expressed above are the author\u2019s own. <em>This blog is only for education purpose.

That\u2019s mostly because residential properties have failed to size up, with returns not matching the golden era of early 2000s.  Looking at 2013-18, residential property price appreciation in India bottomed out to a mere 12 percent \u2013 which effectively worked out to a little over 2 percent annually, even for properties at prime locations.  Imagine someone buying and selling such a property during this window. Their returns were not up to the mark. After all, the average 5-year return for housing across top 7 Indian cities was over 60 percent during the boom years of 2004-08.  If you look at the unorganized real estate, things look grim -- the drop is nearly 40 percent during 2009-12.  Goodbye, real estate investors? Not quite.  <strong>Slowdown \u2013 Geography plays a role</strong> The sheer size and composition of India make realty a unique case study. Hyderabad, for instance, saw exponential rise in land price during 2004-08, which translated into an over cent-per-cent growth in major localities.  Similarly, Pune saw a significant IT boom during 2009-13, as a result of which land prices appreciated by as much as 60 percent.  What gives? Primarily, it\u2019s the prevalent supportive policies that made the state reap rich dividends.  There are some parts of India that performed extraordinarily well while others didn\u2019t. Simply put, the country is too big to generalize when it came to returns.  The 5-year return trend for Indian residential real estate is a pointer that the previous haphazard growth gradually made way for more realistic and mature market behavior. Some markets are almost end user-driven, which puts the lid on speculative price hikes. Others are oriented more towards investors with a long-term view.  Changing market dynamics and acceptance of such change happened in pockets. Irrespective of geography and the quantum of investment, investors came to terms with this reality. Just like in the stock market, long-term players who see the big picture have responded differently compared to short-term speculators who can only appreciate a quick price rise.  <strong>Real Estate Versus Stocks</strong> It may be noted that stocks and mutual funds despite in-built volatility strike a chord with the conservative Indian retail investor. However, ANAROCK\u2019s recent consumer sentiment survey for H1 2019 suggested that while 25 percent respondents went with stocks and MFs, a majority of more than 57 percent cast their lot with real estate, which even put less risky fixed deposits and safe haven gold in shade.  So, it\u2019s premature to write off real estate as Indians\u2019 inherent love for properties has not collapsed. And investors have evolved in their outlook, now more mindful of alternative options in the residential space itself. The more well-heeled are undoubtedly bullish about Grade A commercial properties at prime locations. The number of investors who can afford such financial exposure is worth noting as the annual per capita income stood at $1,670 in 2016.  <strong>New Residential Money-spinners</strong> Helped by government incentives, affordable housing can give returns to the tune of 8-10 percent in the long term. There are also a number of alternative residential real estate investment options, including serviced apartments, senior living, Smart City-based housing, and co-living. Monthly rental ROI (return on investment) for these residential sub-categories is a lot higher than the mainstay mid-income or luxury housing. So, much depends on how much an investor knows about the rapidly-changing Indian housing market.  For instance, co-living units can fetch as much as 8-11 percent ROI \u2013 a much higher yield than the current average of 1-3 percent in garden-variety residential properties. There are profitable asset classes in residential real estate, but few investors are actually scouring the radar.  <strong>Commercial Real Estate A Bright Spot</strong> In earlier years, most \u2018retail\u2019 (small-ticket) investors banked on residential properties. Today, wealthier investors are eyeing commercial ones and \u2018sunshine\u2019 sectors like warehousing. With REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) seeing the light of day, commercial real estate is keeping investors hooked.  The recent oversubscription of the Embassy-Blackstone REIT definitely sends out a clear signal to global as well as domestic investors \u2013 it\u2019s a good time to grab a piece of the Indian office property pie. In fact, we expect REIT investors to become more bullish and take stake in multiple Indian commercial assets that may get listed under REITs in future.  Under such a framework, small-time investors rightfully sense the unveiling of a major new investment avenue comparable to that available in more developed nations. Meanwhile, Indian commercial properties are generating a lot of interest among wealthy investors. This segment has performed much better than housing over the past few years.  Housing sales across major Indian cities have been muted, especially after demonetization (DeMo), implementation of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA) and the Goods &amp; Services Tax (GST).  Meanwhile, commercial office leasing ROI has gone up y-o-y.  <strong>Residential \u2013 Down, But Not Out</strong> In the past, many investors made a killing in residential properties by timing the purchase and selling them off. Certainly, given the new regulatory environment and existing norms that prevent \u2018flipping\u2019, speculative short-term investment in the Indian housing sector no longer makes sense.  To realize 8-10 percent annual returns or more today, housing investors must have a horizon of at least 5-7 years. Meanwhile, they can earn rental income from an asset that has perennial inherent demand.  In developed countries with organized property markets, alternative residential real estate investments for the long term have earned returns on par with those of equity and MFs -- with far less volatility.  India is in a state of flux, with a premium on transparency, governance and discipline. You can expect better times ahead.  But for now, Indian housing prices will hardly see any shift. In coming days, the pent-up demand of more than 10 million units will hold sway and drive up rental and capital value of all barring the ill-chosen ones.  From urban to suburban, and from peri-urban to rural, the inherent demand for housing \u2013 and the potential return on investment \u2013 is beyond doubt.  <em><strong>(The writer is Chairman, ANAROCK Property Consultants.

The government in its new avatar must summon courage to tackle the trouble spots.</h2> It started off with much fanfare and is billed as one of the flagship programmes of Narendra Modi\u2019s first stint as the Prime Minister.  But that was then. Years down the line, Startup India is now a poor shadow of its former self, way short of expectations as much of the promised funds are yet to come by.  With Modi taking over the reins one more time on May 30, will Startup India get going finally? Let's first look at what held back the scheme.  The signature scheme leaned heavily on Rs 10,000 crore funds support, along with incentives to the tune of Rs 1,000 crore, to boost high technology startups. Also, new incubators, accelerators and 100 more innovation zones by 2024 were part of the blueprint.  The initial euphoria faded quickly. In fact, some of the key aspects of the 19-point agenda never saw the light of day. To make matters worse, only close to <a href=\"https://qz.com/india/1159621/startup-india-with-only-10-of-funds-disbursed-modis-grand-plan-for-entrepreneurs-is-sputtering/\">10 percent</a> of the promised funds have been released so far.  To be sure, Startup India took off with best of intentions, but floundered because of implementation inefficiency. According to a <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/many-startups-say-yet-to-benefit-from-startup-india/articleshow/61924868.cms?from=mdr\">survey</a> in December 2017, nearly 80 percent of startups did not benefit from the programme.  Some say the biggest challenges still are delay in sanctions, corruption (<a href=\"https://qz.com/india/1515065/bureaucracy-corruption-gst-are-limiting-indian-startups/\">according to a survey by Local Circles</a>) and the all-pervasive paperwork. While one of the major objectives was to offer tax benefits to new-age companies, less than 100 of them managed to secure it during the first year of the launch.  It was towards the end of Modi\u2019s tenure, startups started facing challenges, with the angel tax acting as a major dampener. To give the credit where it\u2019s due, the election-bound Modi government then dealt with the issue tactfully and granted angel tax exemption to <a href=\"https://yourstory.com/2019/05/startups-dpiit-angel-tax-exemption\">more than 500 startups</a>.  The story is far from complete. The angel tax issue is yet to be resolved fully, given a few <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/comment-angel-tax-before-defining-startups-define-fair-market-value-3491671.html\">undefined areas</a>. Resolving this issue may be treated by the Modi government as a priority in the coming months.  There are other pain points as well. Digital India, which came along with Startup India, promised delivery of government services to citizens by improving online infrastructure. It did get some traction, but the concept was more than connecting the unconnected. The bigger objective was to ensure India leaps onto the advanced technology highway. That is still work in progress.  The major peeve of home-grown startups is the paperwork, which is seen as a big roadblock in the age of the internet, especially when the government is shouting from the rooftops about the success of Digital India. Reducing the paperwork could make the process smoother.  After the initial phases of Startup India, even fund flows slowed, especially at the seed stage. The inflow of seed capital or angel investments dropped by more than 20 percent during January-September 2018 compared with that of the same period a year ago.  After Modi\u2019s jaw-dropping electoral mandate, India\u2019s startup community is a hopeful lot. Their expectation is that issues holding back growth of startups should be resolved sooner than later.  Modi 2.0 would do well to look beyond metros cities. There are many small-scale startups in rural India that are <a href=\"https://yourstory.com/2019/05/startup-bharat-beyond-metros-deep-tech-solutions-real-india-problems\">working on real problems by using technology</a>. According to available data, startups in smaller cities raised nearly $447.66 million in 2018, a three-fold jump from 2017. It\u2019s time Startup India becomes Startup Bharat.  Founders of local startups have given their verdict, too. They expect the government to lay down simpler and clearer guidelines, particularly in tier-II and tier-III cities, which would help startups get back in shape. More so because lack of funding remains a major irritant. This is one area that Startup India can tackle urgently at the seed stage by widening reach.  Another key demand is to create a Bharat Inclusion Fund with a focus on resolving the issues startups face in smaller cities.  Setting up common infrastructure at the district level, which can easily be accessed by startups as incubation centres, can go a long way in realizing the potential. These centres may also be used for sharing resources.  In five years, the Modi government will be judged again on its track record of encouraging startups in India. If it learns from the first tenure, then the second tenure could be a more fruitful one, both for the startup community and their employees.  <strong>Author: Sounak Mitra, Associate Editor, Moneycontrol.</strong> <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Views expressed above are the author\u2019s own. <em>This blog is only for education purpose.

The budget went at length about how the government intends to transform India with new initiatives like water management, clean rivers, space program, Digital India and so on. The government laid out 10 agendas for the next decade. If the government can achieve what it has set out to do, India would be closer to the \u2018developed economy\u2019 tag.  But these intents are for the long term. The stock market believes in instant nirvana. There was nothing that markets thought it could cheer. Sensex fell by 395 points, while Nifty was down by 136 points. But the pain was widespread across all sectors and market caps. Out of BSE 500, as many as 406 scrips declined, suggesting how badly the budget failed to live up to the market expectations.  Since we did not see any pre-budget rally this time around, there was hope that we could see a post-budget rally. But that hope, for the time being, has been dashed.  <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1763\"src=\"https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/aaa.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"830\"height=\"416\"/> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1764\"src=\"https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bbbb.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"828\"height=\"467\"/> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1765\"src=\"https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ccc.jpg\"alt=\"\"width=\"835\"height=\"457\"/> <strong>So why did the market take a beating?</strong> There was nothing major negative in the budget; except for the fact that now there would be 20 percent tax on buyback of equity shares on the lines of the dividend distribution tax. Also, the super-rich having an annual income of more than Rs 2 crore would pay more tax. But the big relief was that there was no announcement of the inheritance tax, which was anticipated widely. But the expectation of the cost of indexation on capital gains on equity did not come through. This was needed on the same lines as enjoyed by other capital assets. The hope got postponed by one more year. The proposal of a minimum public holding of 35 percent from the present 25 percent is another dampener. Many MNCs and Indian companies have promoters\u2019 stake at 75 percent. Now the budget is suggesting that they should bring it down to at least 65 percent. This will increase the supply, pushing the share prices down. TCS (promoters\u2019 stake 72 percent) lost 3.55 percent, while Siemens (promoters\u2019 stake 75 percent) cracked by 8 percent. There was an expectation in the market that the MNCs holding a 75 percent stake may make an open offer to take the company private. Now MNCs will have to bite the bullet \u2013 either take the company private or dilute the stake. Even the most-awaited corporate tax rate cut did not happen for the large corporates. What the FM did is that 25 percent corporate tax rate was extended from the company having a turnover of Rs 250 crore to Rs 400 crore. The cut in corporate the tax would have left more money for the corporates to spend on capex.  On the positive side, the Finance Minister did a brilliant job of maintaining a fiscal deficit. There was a fear that we may slip off from the fiscal deficit target as the revenue buoyancy is not that great, while many government schemes would need money to fund the same. While the interim budget presented by Piyush Goyal had estimated fiscal deficit at 3.4 percent, Nirmala Sitharaman brought it down to 3.3 percent, maintaining the glide path. This would be the lowest fiscal deficit India would have in the last, one decade. In the recent past, our lowest fiscal deficit was in FY2008, when it had got reduced to 2.6 percent. Maintaining the glide path would go a long way in terms of India\u2019s credibility of fiscal discipline. This could also help in improving the credit rating of the country. The government will also have the headroom as it has not budgeted for any revenue from the spectrum auction. At the same time, taxing the super-rich is expected to fetch Rs 12,000 crore, while Rs 90,000 crore is expected from the RBI as a special dividend. The Bimal Jalan committee would come out with its report soon, but it is believed that the amount could be in excess of Rs 1 lac crore. That will give more headroom to contain the deficit.  <strong>Inflation may increase</strong> The government needs money to fund various schemes like MGNREGA and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. One of the best reliable ways of funding these schemes is hiking the tax on petrol and diesel. This time too, the FM has relied on this. She increased the special additional excise duty and cess by Re 1 each (total Rs 2 per litre). But these measures could stoke inflation. Till now, the rainfall has been in deficit. Poor monsoon with higher transportation cost could push the inflation higher, thereby limiting RBI\u2019s ability to reduce the interest rate.  <strong>So, what could be the strategy for the investors post-budget?</strong> I believe that the market from Monday onwards would start reacting to global news and the progress of monsoon. The most-watched factor would be the commentaries given by the corporates post-June results. The recent comments from Marico and Godrej Consumer Products clearly suggest that there is a slowdown in the rural economy. Higher allocation to MGNREGA and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana would help improve purchasing power in the rural economy. The recent hike in MSPs of various Agri commodities by up to five percent should also help. But the Rs 2 hike in the prices of petrol and diesel could impact the purchasing power.  The right strategy in this market should be to stick to good quality companies that are available at reasonable valuations. Avoid companies that are leveraged and where promoters have pledged a good part of their holdings. Also, look at the management commentary on June quarter numbers. Normally, July is a lucky month for the stock market. Despite not so market-cheering budget, I have a feeling that July should offer good gains for the investors. Hence, remain invested in the market. Any decline in the prices of good quality stocks should be used as an opportunity to enter the stock rather than moving out.  <strong>Author: </strong><strong>Sunil Damania</strong> <strong>CIO, </strong><a href=\"http://www.marketsmojo.com\"><strong>www.marketsmojo.com</strong></a> <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Views expressed above are the author\u2019s own. <em>This blog is only for education purpose.

Its dilemma for investors-where the market headed for?  Last one month was depressing for the investors. The market behaved like there was no future as stock prices fell heavily, with many stocks losing as much as 30 percent in a month. In the last few months, Investors bought at every fall, thinking it is a good time to invest, but share prices fell further, thereby creating self-doubt. This kind of rapid fall does not happen so often. With gloomy news engulfing all the markets \u2013 be it domestic or international \u2013 it is becoming difficult to come up with convincing reasons to buy in the market.  <strong>Post budget rally belied</strong> When the July month began, there was a big hope that it would prove to be a good month for the investors. There were a couple of reasons for the same. First, this time we did not see any pre-budget rally. Hence, the belief was that with the strong mandate given by the people to the Modi government, the budget would be bold and reformist, thereby pushing investors\u2019 sentiments higher. Hence, the market was expecting a post-budget rally. The second reason for the market to be good is that historically the month of July has given positive returns to the investors. The Sensex has given positive returns ranging from 1.20 percent to 6.16 percent every year in the month of July over the last few years.  But both these hypothesis have gone kaput. The budget failed to live up to the market\u2019s expectations (here read my previous column <em>\u2013 </em><a href=\"https://www.marketsmojo.com/blog/investmentletters/why-the-stock-market-gave-a-thumbs-down-to-budget-1446.html\"><em>\u201cWhy the stock market gave a \u2018Thumbs down\u2019 to the budget\u201d</em></a>). The most irritating thing in the budget seems to be the tax on the super-rich. In the process, FPIs having the structure of trusts also came under the ambit of the super-rich tax (but not those FPIs having corporate structure). FPIs sold heavily in the month of July, leading to an outflow of Rs 12,419 crore. In fact, before the budget, the FPIs were net buyers almost every month in 2019. This shows how badly the FPIs were disappointed with the budget. Year-to-date, the FPIs are still net buyers to the tune of Rs 63,596 crore.  Due to heavy selling by the FPIs, India\u2019s overall market cap fell from Rs 1.52 lac crore (June) to Rs 1.41 lac crore (July) \u2013 a fall of 7.34 percent! The fall in small-caps was more severe with the BSE Smallcap index falling as much as 11 percent in one month.  <strong>June quarter numbers did not help either</strong> At the same time, corporate India\u2019s results were also a mixed bag that did not provide any major clue that one could take relief from. The sentiment is so poor that if a company declares results as per market expectations, it would fall by 2-3 percent. But if a company declared poor results, it would fall by 15-20 percent. In either case, the trajectory is downward. Of the 69 large-cap companies (having a market cap above Rs 20,000 crore), as many as 49 companies are quoting below the prices on the results day. With concerns on earnings growth, many projections are being revised downward. All hopes are now pinned on the second half of FY20 as many people believe that the demand should revive, including the auto sector.  <strong>But there are positives too</strong> But despite so much gloom, there are few positive factors investors must take note of. First, there is a slowdown in the demand and not degrowth. Which means the growth rate has come down, but India Inc.\u2019s volume growth is still positive. We are not in a recession. The IMF scaled down India\u2019s GDP growth rate from 7.3 percent to 7 percent. This is still higher than most of the other leading economies in the world. Companies like Asian Paints and Marico reported smarter volume growth, suggesting that the slowdown has been blown out of proportion by a few bear operators to create panic in the market. The strong performances of Reliance Retail as well as Avenue Supermarts (D\u2019Mart) clearly show that people have not stopped buying products. The recent report from Cushman and Wakefield shows that the gross leasing of office space doubled to 18.7 million square feet in the first quarter of the current financial year from 9.28 million square feet of the same period last year.  Somewhere, the market should take heart from these data points too. Right now, the monthly auto numbers have become a barometer of the state of the Indian economy. That\u2019s hurting the sentiment to a great extent. Despite challenging macros, India Inc has posted overall net profit growth of almost 6 percent (excluding telecom companies). So, on the one hand, the profits are growing (albeit at a slower pace) and, on the other hand, market caps are falling, thereby making many stocks attractive from a valuation point of view. My 25 years of stock market experience suggests that the market cannot ignore fundamental factors for too long.  Another positive factor is that the monsoon is picking up. The recent IMD prediction is that the monsoon would be normal in August and September as the fear of El-Nino is receding. This should revive the demand from rural India, thereby spurring economic activities.  India has always faced problems as and when the crude oil prices have moved up. But in the last four months, crude oil price trend has been downward. India\u2019s average crude oil basket price was $71 per barrel in April 2019 and it has steadily come down to $62.39 in June 2019. So, more than 10 percent fall in crude oil prices would provide great comfort for the Indian economy.  Another big factor that many are ignoring is the RBI\u2019s constant rate cuts. Normally, it takes 6-8 months to transmit the cut to the consumer. The first-rate cut happened in February, and hence, by Diwali one should see major transmission of rate cuts to the retail level. As and when that happens, there would be a lesser burden on India Inc to service the debt.<strong> </strong> <strong>So what should one do?</strong> The most obvious question everyone is pondering now \u2013 should we buy in this market or should we sell, as the portfolio is going down every day?  My answer is firm: Buy! I know I am going contra on the market. If you sell in this market, you would surely repent your decision six months down the line. Right now, fear has taken over logical thinking. This is where I will borrow the famous quote of Warren Buffett who had said, \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.\u201d This is the right time to construct the portfolio. If you can do this, you will remember me 12 months down the line when optimism would have replaced fear. If you are confused about constructing your portfolio, our <a href=\"https://www.marketsmojo.com/mojo/modelportfolio_investment\">Model Portfolio</a> will help you to do the same.  Having said that, there is a fair possibility that the market could slide further from this level. But remember, no one can buy at the bottom. Hence, don\u2019t worry if the value of your portfolio goes down in the interim. Your objective is to create a winning portfolio over the long term. However, if for some reason, you are weak-hearted and do not have the courage to put your money in this market, I would sincerely advise you to stop tracking the market for some time. Take a break. Else, out of fear, you could get into some irrational trades by selling good quality companies. I repeat \u2013 the current share prices are not good levels to sell, unless you are holding poor quality companies.  The way we have seen a quick fall, my assumption is that the bounce-back would be equally quick. I am convinced that we are close to the bottom and hence time to buy. Are you convinced too?

Or what if we could go back in time and see for ourselves, how the world used to be in times of Jurassic Park? As much as we would like this to happen, it can\u2019t. However, the technology has made it possible to simulate these scenarios and try to make one feel as if it were happening for real. Similar simulation practices are followed in Stress-testing techniques of financial world. Umpteen number of simulations are conducted over many different scenarios to come to a near-perfect conclusion. What if I say, the nature has made this stress-test possible in real world?  Covid-19 is as good as a stress-test for businesses around the globe. The contagious property of this virus has brought the world to a stand-still. The virus\u2019 ability to spread quickly just through a touch has made it nearly impossible for people to move out of their houses let alone going to work. This has extremely impacted the businesses and their daily operations. Most of the countries are under a strict lockdown restricting movement of people resulting in shut down of Schools, colleges, offices, etc. Millions of employees have been laid off all over the world, numerous companies have shut down, and few big players have declared bankruptcy. Now, are you prepared for this test?  Assessment of your business is customary at this moment. How will you assess if your business can withstand the storm? It\u2019s simple \u2013 a few tick marks on your checklist will make the decision.  <ul> <li>Solidarity of the management \u2013 How is top management of the company dealing with this situation. Their decision-making skills will speak volumes for the stability of the company. Quick, witty and right decision is need of the hour</li> <li>Morale of employees \u2013 Employees need their jobs right now, more than ever. In such situations, a common cost-reduction measure is cutting down on employee workforce. However, many companies fail to understand that employees drive any business. It\u2019s the employees that execute the \u201cgood\u201d decisions made by management. Any company laying off the employees makes the other employees that are still in the company, less confident and the productivity eventually draws down. Does that mean the companies should NOT reduce costs? That brings me to my next point\u2026</li> <li>Reserves \u2013 If a business does not have enough liquidity to sustain for even 2 months, can it really exist in the long-term? That\u2019s the question every CFO should be asked. Reserves are the most reliable funds to turn to, in times of need. Your company must have enough liquid reserves to pay all the fixed costs, salaries of the employees, adjust for the bad debts and still stand on the field untethered. Now, this also does not mean that the business doesn\u2019t need cost-reductions because cost reductions and reserves are two sides of the same coin\u2026</li> <li>What can be compromised to reduce cost? \u2013 Cost should be reduced in sensible areas of the business. Some areas like, sourcing strategies for manufacturing companies can be tweaked \u2013 they can start sourcing locally while still maintaining quality of the product., complimentary lines of business that are not getting any revenue can be discontinued and all that capital can be directed towards operating the main business efficiently. Adopting the work from home model would reduce other costs like electricity, daily operational cost significantly, while still maintaining employee productivity. Some strategic and carefully thought alliances and decisions would prove extremely fruitful</li> <li>Stakeholders\u2019 confidence in your company \u2013 Many businesses are standing still and strong staring the storm right in its eye. This is only plausible due to the long-standing good will of the company with all its stakeholders. Like family supports an individual in all his phases, these stakeholders support the business. If your company has a good product/service offering and right relations with all its stakeholders, then, this too shall pass.</li> <li>Maintain the topline \u2013 It is inevitable that the bottom line will be hurt in this situation, but, what about the topline? Can that be saved from taking a hit? For some businesses, Yes. It is advisable to maintain the revenue level in order to maintain investors\u2019 confidence in the business. Entire economy is taking the blow, but some demands cannot cease to exist. One must use this opportunity to strategically and smoothly enter into a new line of  business or alliance in order to keep the firm going. Sure, this requires a serious risk appetite, which brings me to my last point\u2026</li> <li>Effective Risk Management \u2013 What is Risk Management? It\u2019s the ability to manage an unforeseen, uncertain situation with utmost vigor and efficiency. It is necessary for your business to have a risk management process in place which would ensure the company suffers less loss. The risk management team would assess amount of risk in every decision, quantify it and hedge it as much as possible. The risk managers stress-test various scenarios and forecast the extent of capital that should be reserved for uncertain events which eventually maintains liquidity and keeps the concern going.</li> </ul>", "slug": "covid-19-a-real-life-stress-test-for-your-business", "category": "uncategorized", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/24621.jpg"}, {"title": "SEBI has put a threshold on money that can be invested by a fund.", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/sebi-has-put-a-threshold-on-money-that-can-be-invested-by-a-fund/", "content": "The Securities and Exchange Board of India has announced that Category 1 and 2 of Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) can invest not more than 25% of the investable funds in an investee company directly or investment in the units of other alternative investment funds.

An AIF could invest more than 25% of the funds in one company, either directly or indirectly, under certain conditions.

The sectors affected now are certainly looking to soar once the new normal sets in. Diversification helps in the long run during these volatile times when you seek different investment instruments to keep your capital safe.  We are currently seeing certain sectors and thematic funds doing well with an inflow of positive returns which are continuing to draw the investor's interest. The net inflow in such funds was \u20b911,084 Crores in the past 12 months, making it the highest among equity fund categories. Commodity focussed funds benefitted from the increase in prices of ferrous and non-ferrous metals while exotic fund offerings such as ESG focussed themes and Pharma funds have proved to be favourites. The Assets under Management (AUM) of sectoral and thematic funds rose by 79% year-on-year to \u20b91.1 lakh crore at the end of April and are now the third-largest category of equity funds, behind Large-cap and Flexi-cap segments. Some of these funds are ICICI Prudential Commodity fund, Nippon India Pharma, and SBI Magnum Global Funds.  Whether these investments are done with dry powder or panic selling, they have seen a stark increase in AUM as well as returns. But one must keep in mind that the new normal will eventually settle in and a diversified portfolio where sectors hit are now having their share prices at a discount, will prove to be a good decision to keep in the diversified basket of a rebalanced portfolio.  In conclusion, a diversified portfolio can help you make better investment decisions with the following advantages: <ul> <li>Investing in different asset classes can help you reduce your portfolio\u2019s volatility and helps you to avoid making rash decisions based on market swings.</li> <li>Each asset usually performs differently in the short, medium, and long term. Therefore, investing in multiple assets encourage you to make long-term investments and it also may reduce the number of times that the portfolio needs to be monitored.</li> <li>It reduces the overall impact of market volatility, which can provide stability in times of uncertainty and bring peace of mind for the investor.</li> </ul> &nbsp; &nbsp; Disclaimer:  This disclaimer informs readers that the views, thoughts, and opinions expressed in the text belong solely to the author and are based on facts taken from the Economic Times and Etoro.", "slug": "covid-19-calls-for-more-diversification-not-less", "category": "uncategorized", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/EggsOneBasket_Header.jpg"}, {"title": "Crypto Exchanges prefer SEBI or a New Entity as Regulator, Not RBI.", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/crypto-exchanges-prefer-sebi-or-a-new-entity-as-regulator-not-rbi/", "content": "Top Crypto Exchanges have conveyed to the government that they believe SEBI to be a better-suited regulator than RBI as crypto assets are closer to commodities like gold than currency. The exchanges have also pitched the alternate of having a new regulator for Cryptocurrencies.  As per Lok Sabha Bulletin Part II, The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021 was introduced by the Government of India to ban trading and investments in private cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin during the Budget session of the Parliament and to provide the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) with the legal powers to develop Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). According to experts, this could lead to legal issues as it could be challenged in a court of law. With respect to tax purposes, there is no clarity as to whether crypto assets are currency, commodity service, or closer to equity.  <blockquote><strong>\u201cThis will entirely depend on how the government plans to utilize the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, but the easiest way to regulate it currently would be to classify it under SEBI as their norms do align in some ways with crypto.\u201d</strong> <p style=\"text-align: right\">\u2013 Monark Modi, Founder of Cryptocurrency Exchange Bitex.</p> <strong>\u201cEvery industry needs a healthy regulatory environment for sustainable growth and the crypto industry being a fairly new concept needs support from RBI and SEBI, both.

The closest they come to is Gold, a category in which they can trade and invest. Furthermore, experts advising the Indian Exchanges argue that cryptocurrencies are also not private assets as they do not have an owner or an issuer. The exchanges have been pushing to get recognition in one way or the other as there is no recognition under the law, including tax regulations.  CBDCs are seen as a regulated alternative to cryptocurrencies and on 25 January 2021, the RBI stated that it is examining if there is a need to introduce CBDC in India. In case, the need for a digital currency arises, the bank will look for ways to operationalize it. In its February 2020 Bulletin, RBI cited the survey of central banks conducted by the Bank for International Settlements which revealed that around 80% of the 66 responding banks have started projects to explore the use of CBDC, including Canada, the USA, and Singapore.  &nbsp; &nbsp; Disclaimer:  This disclaimer informs readers that the views, thoughts, and opinions expressed in the text belong solely to the author and are based on facts taken from the Economic Times and Jagran Josh.", "slug": "crypto-exchanges-prefer-sebi-or-a-new-entity-as-regulator-not-rbi", "category": "uncategorized", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/dogecoin-litecoin-etheteum-and-bitcoin-PS98VLU-scaled.jpg"}, {"title": "ETFs could be the way to go for Passive investors looking for sector-specific investments.", "link": "https://credentglobal.com/etfs-could-be-the-way-to-go-for-passive-investors-looking-for-sector-specific-investments/", "content": "Tech funds have been top-performing in the past decade alongside Pharma and Healthcare funds and are some of the best-represented sectors.

Passive investors are on the rise since Covid-19 and this has led to more investment options being created for investors where ETFs could be a safer bet compared to actively managed funds.  Currently, with some sectors performing better than others, sector-specific ETFs are seeing rapid growth in investment. In April, sectoral and thematic funds saw the highest net inflows among all equity sub-categories at \u20b91,705 crores. Investment professionals often seek to generate alpha (excess returns) for clients through sector funds.  <blockquote><strong>\u201cIn October, I was keen on allocating more of my clients\u2019 portfolios to metals and there was no sector fund available for it.

This will lead to an increase in the cost of acquiring clients. A Robo-Advisor is an algorithm-driven, low-cost, automated investment advisor to small retail investors who usually can afford to only invest as low as \u20b9500 in Mutual Funds as most traditional advisors do not cater to small investors. Fin-tech companies are able to keep costs low due to all processes being automated.  SEBI declares that digital consent between an investment advisor and an investor cannot be considered valid and has insisted on a physical agreement. Till now, most fin-tech companies had prospective clients agreeing to the terms online before onboarding them. But SEBI rules do not make any distinction between an investment advisor and a Robo advisor when it comes to the mandatory agreement between the advisor and the client. Following the new guidance, a few fin-tech firms have put a hold on their plans of having a Robo-Advisor as it renders the business model unviable.  <blockquote> <strong>\u201cIt is surprising that an investor can open a trading account with brokers, invest in mutual funds and make investments in other securities in a completely digital manner but only for receiving investment advice that physical copies of agreements need to be signed,\u201d </strong> <p style=\"text-align: right\">- Anil Choudhary, Partner, Finsec Advisors</p> </blockquote> <p style=\"text-align: left\">This has led some of the smaller fin-tech players to explore innovative alternate structures to stay out of the scope of SEBI\u2019s rules.

To this effect, it is to be noted that the policy rates have not seen any change, however, the growth percentage that was earlier projected for this fiscal year has been cut down a whole percentage point. It was also stated that Rs. 1.2 trillion of government securities would be bought, and this would be treated under their own way of quantitative easing for quarter two.  The repo rate was unanimously decided to be kept unhinged by the Monetary Policy Committee and would be so as to ensure that there is sustainable growth while aiming to alleviate the severe impact of Covid-19 on our economy. This has also been kept in mind while aiming to keep the inflation levels within the limit over the next fiscal year. Keeping in mind also the fact that the Real GDP growth rate has been cut from 10.5% to 9.5%, while the inflation forecast was slightly increased, Q1 is expected to see a Real GDP growth of 18.5%, followed by Q2 seeing 7.9%, 7.2% in Q3 and the last quarter seeing a 6.6% growth. To make a comparison with the initial forecast, the RBI expected a 26.2% growth for Q1, Q2 saw an 8.3% growth, followed by Q3 seeing a 5.4% growth, and the last quarter looking at 6.2%. It is expected that the rural demand will remain strong owing to a normal monsoon that is predicted. The increased severity of Covid-19, however, within the rural areas poses a set of risks circling back to the initial forecast, and hence, considering the effect of all these factors, the new forecast is decreased to 9.5%. Two engines of growth have majorly been hit by this decrease namely investment and private consumption.  The interest rates have been kept constant and unchanged by the RBI in the hopes of reviving the economy and sustaining growth. The rates have been maintained at 4.25%, and in accordance with this, the reverse repo rate also does not see a change. To be noted also is how effectively these policies will help revive the economy within time. The economists at CRISIL state that due to the Covid-19 restrictions which they believe will go on till August at least, there will be huge immobility due to this, and till that time, it would be difficult to actually measure growth. Additionally, the recovery of the economy will also be affected by the rate at which the citizens are being vaccinated.  &nbsp; <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1915\"src=\"https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png\"alt=\"\"width=\"1100\"height=\"709\"/> DISCLAIMER: This disclaimer informs readers that the views, thoughts, and opinions expressed in the text are based on facts taken from Business Today and Live Mint.", "slug": "second-wave-and-the-indian-economy", "category": "uncategorized", "image": "https://credentglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/view-how-to-pull-the-indian-economy-out-of-its-rut.jpg"}]
